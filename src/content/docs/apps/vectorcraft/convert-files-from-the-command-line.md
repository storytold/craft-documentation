This guide shows you how to convert files with `vectorcraft-cli convert`, which opens a file and writes it in another format without opening a VectorCraft window. It also covers the options for artboards, image resolution, SVG and legacy `.ai` files, how to read the result, how to convert a folder of files, and the `info` and `bench` subcommands.

## Convert one file

1. Open a terminal. On Windows the installer does not add `vectorcraft-cli` to `PATH`; [Automate VectorCraft](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/#run-commands-from-the-command-line) lists where each install puts it.
2. Type `vectorcraft-cli convert`, the file to read, and the file to write:

   ```sh
   vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft festival-posters.pdf
   ```

3. Press Enter. VectorCraft reads the first file, writes the second one in the format its extension names, and prints one line of JSON that describes the result.

`convert` reads any format that **File → Open…** reads. It writes these formats: `.vectorcraft`, `.svg`, `.svgz`, `.pdf`, `.ai`, `.ait`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.tif`, `.bmp`, `.vctemplate`, `.txt`, `.dxf`, `.eps`, `.emf`, `.wmf`, `.tga` and `.psd`. A conversion keeps live effects and hidden layers and objects. SVG and PSD files mark the hidden ones as hidden.

To write a `.ait` template, give an output file that ends in `.ait`. The template holds every artboard, so `--artboard` and `--range` cannot be used with it.

`vectorcraft-cli --help` prints every subcommand with its options, followed by the formats VectorCraft reads and writes. `--help` or `-h` after a subcommand, as in `vectorcraft-cli convert --help`, prints the same text. `vectorcraft-cli --version` (or `-V`) prints the version, for example `vectorcraft-cli 0.24.1`.

When a conversion fails, `vectorcraft-cli` prints the reason after `vectorcraft-cli:` on standard error and exits with a nonzero status.

## Choose the artboards

Each artboard has a number in the **Artboards** panel. `--artboard` (`-a`) picks one artboard, counted from 0. `--range` (`-r`) picks artboards by the numbers the panel shows, counted from 1. A range can list single artboards and spans, such as `1-3,5`, or be `all`.

![The festival-posters document with the Artboard tool active and three posters side by side, labeled 01 - Night Market, 02 - Lantern Walk and 03 - Harbor Fair. The Artboards panel on the right lists the same three artboards in order, and the status bar shows the Artboard tool hints.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/convert-files-from-the-command-line-artboards.webp)

In this document, `--artboard 1` picks Lantern Walk, and `--range 2-3` picks Lantern Walk and Harbor Fair:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft lantern-walk.png --artboard 1
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft walk-and-fair.pdf --range 2-3
```

When you give neither option, the output format sets what is written:

| Output | Artboards written by default | With several artboards picked |
|---|---|---|
| PDF and PDF-compatible `.ai` | Every artboard, one page each | One page for each picked artboard |
| EPS | The bounds of all the artwork | A file of all the artwork, plus one file for each picked artboard |
| SVG | The first artboard | One file for each picked artboard |
| PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, TGA, PSD, EMF, WMF | The first artboard | Not possible: these formats hold one artboard |
| DXF | One drawing of all the artwork, with the bottom-left corner of the first artboard as its origin | Not possible: a DXF drawing has one origin. With one picked artboard, the bottom-left corner of that artboard is the origin. |
| Legacy `.ai` (version 7) | Every artboard, one file each | One file for each picked artboard |
| `.ait` template | Every artboard | Not possible: the conversion stops with an error |
| `.vectorcraft`, `.vctemplate` | The whole document | The whole document: the options have no effect |
| `.txt` | The text of every type object in the document | The same text: the options have no effect |

When a format cannot take the artboards you picked, the conversion stops with an error and writes no file.

When an export writes one file for each artboard, VectorCraft names each file after the output file and the artboard, for example `walk-and-fair-Lantern-Walk.svg`. EPS files join the two parts with `_` instead of `-`, as in `walk-and-fair_Lantern-Walk.eps`. Characters other than letters, digits, `-` and `_` in an artboard name become `-`, an artboard with no name is written as `Artboard-` and its number, and a name that is already used gets `-2`, `-3` and so on. The result's `files` field lists every file that was written.

To export several artboards as images, export a PDF, or use **File → Export → Export for Screens…** as described in [Export for screens and the web](/apps/vectorcraft/export-for-screens-and-the-web/). To rename or reorder artboards, see [Manage artboards](/apps/vectorcraft/manage-artboards/).

## Set the resolution of image exports

For PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, TGA and PSD files, VectorCraft sets the number of pixels from the first of these that applies:

1. `--ppi`: pixels per inch, a positive number.
2. `--scale` (`-s`): pixels per point, so `--scale 2` gives 144 pixels per inch.
3. The document's raster effects resolution, which you set with **Effect → Document Raster Effects Settings…**. A document with no setting uses 72 pixels per inch.

For example, a 360 by 540 pt artboard exports at 360 by 540 pixels at 72 pixels per inch, at 720 by 1080 pixels with `--scale 2`, and at 1500 by 2250 pixels with `--ppi 300`:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft lantern-walk-2x.png --artboard 1 --scale 2
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft lantern-walk-print.png --artboard 1 --ppi 300
```

When you give both options, `--ppi` is used. Formats that are not images ignore both options.

## SVG options

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--outline-text` | Off | Writes each piece of type as paths, so the SVG shows the same letter shapes on a computer that does not have the fonts. The text can no longer be edited as text. |
| `--decimals N` | `3` | Sets how many decimal places SVG coordinates keep, from 1 to 7. Any other number stops the conversion with the error `decimals must be 1–7`. |

For example, this command writes the Night Market poster with its titles as outlines:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft night-market.svg --artboard 0 --outline-text
```

When you open `night-market.svg` in VectorCraft, each title is a compound path instead of a type object, and the Direct Selection tool shows the anchor points of its letters.

![The night-market.svg poster open in VectorCraft with the Direct Selection tool active and the NIGHT MARKET title selected, showing anchor points along every letter. The Layers panel lists the Titles layer holding two Compound Path rows, above the Lanterns and Background layers, and the status bar shows the Direct Selection tool hints.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/convert-files-from-the-command-line-outlined-svg.webp)

## Write a legacy .ai file

By default, a `.ai` output file is a PDF-compatible `.ai` file that carries the VectorCraft document. `--ai-version 7` writes a legacy `.ai` file of version 7 instead, for apps that read only that older form. A version 7 file keeps layers, groups, compound paths, clipping groups, type, colors, gradients and images. Other appearance features are expanded into plain objects, and transparent objects are written opaque.

```sh
vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft harbor-fair.ai --range 3 --ai-version 7
```

A version 7 file holds one artboard. Without `--artboard` or `--range`, VectorCraft writes one file for each artboard, named after the output file and the artboard. For example, `vectorcraft-cli convert festival-posters.vectorcraft festival.ai --ai-version 7` writes `festival-Night-Market.ai`, `festival-Lantern-Walk.ai` and `festival-Harbor-Fair.ai`.

In the Harbor Fair file below, the lantern glows, the stars and the water lines are solid. They are partly transparent in the source document, so the version 7 file writes them opaque: each glow is now the larger solid oval around its lantern.

`--ai-version` takes `pdf` (the default) or `7`. A `.ait` template cannot be version 7. These two options apply only with `--ai-version 7`:

| Option | Values | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--hidden-objects` | `layer` (default), `omit`, `visible` | Version 7 files can hide layers but not objects. `layer` moves each layer's hidden objects to a hidden layer just above it, named after the layer with ` (hidden)` added. `omit` leaves hidden objects out. `visible` writes them as visible objects in their places. |
| `--transparent-images` | `flatten` (default), `omit` | Version 7 images cannot be see-through. `flatten` turns each image with see-through pixels, opacity or a blending mode into an opaque image of itself and the art under it, and keeps that art as it was. `omit` leaves those images out. |

`--outline-text` works with version 7 files as it does with SVG: it writes type as outlines instead of text. Without it, an app that opens the version 7 file sets the text in the fonts the file names, so those fonts need to be installed.

Between the Titles and Lanterns layers is a layer named Lanterns (hidden), with its eye turned off, holding one path.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/convert-files-from-the-command-line-legacy-ai.webp)

To save a `.ai` file from the app with **File → Save As…**, see [Open and save files](/apps/vectorcraft/open-and-save-files/).

## Overwrite the source file

Some files open with parts left out. For example, VectorCraft might read a `.ai` file from its PDF part, which leaves out the art outside its artboards, or skip hidden text, art or layers that it cannot read in a `.ai` or EPS file. When the output file is the same file as the input and reading the input left something out, `convert` stops with an error that names what would be lost, and the original file is not changed.

To write over the original file anyway, add `--replace-lossy`:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli convert poster.ai poster.ai --replace-lossy
```

:::caution
With `--replace-lossy`, whatever reading the file left out is lost for good. Write to a new file name unless you are sure you do not need it.
:::

## Read the warnings

`convert` prints the result as one line of JSON. This is the result of the `--ai-version 7` command in [Write a legacy .ai file](#write-a-legacy-ai-file):

```json
{"bytes":20704,"format":"ai","path":"harbor-fair.ai","warnings":["a legacy .ai (version 7) keeps layers, groups, compound paths, clipping groups, type, colours, gradients and images, not the rest: save as VectorCraft to keep everything editable","transparency (opacity, blending modes, opacity masks) is written opaque: legacy .ai files have none","hidden objects are moved to a hidden layer above their own (legacy .ai files can hide only layers)"]}
```

| Field | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `path` | The file that was written, or the first one when there are several |
| `files` | Every file that was written, when the export wrote more than one |
| `bytes` | The size of the file in `path`, in bytes |
| `format` | The format that was written |
| `warnings` | What the output file could not keep, such as transparency that a format does not support |
| `importWarnings` | What reading the input left out or changed. The field appears only when there is something to report. |

Its `warnings` say what a version 7 file keeps, that transparency is written opaque, and that hidden objects moved to a hidden layer. The source document opened without notes, so the result has no `importWarnings` field. Check both lists before you replace or send the converted file. `--preserve-editing`, `--editing-data` and `--legacy-name-encoding`, which change how `.ai`, EPS and PDF files are read and written, are described in [Automate VectorCraft](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/#convert-a-file).

## Convert a folder of files

`convert` takes one file at a time. To convert a folder, run it in a loop in your shell.

In PowerShell on Windows, this loop writes a PDF for every `.ai` file in `C:\Art\posters` into `C:\Art\pdf`:

```powershell
$cli = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\ArtCraft\VectorCraft\vectorcraft-cli.exe"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force C:\Art\pdf | Out-Null
Get-ChildItem C:\Art\posters -Filter *.ai | ForEach-Object {
  & $cli convert $_.FullName (Join-Path C:\Art\pdf ($_.BaseName + '.pdf'))
  if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Write-Warning "Failed: $($_.Name)" }
}
```

In a `sh` shell on macOS or Linux, this loop writes a PNG at twice the size for every `.svg` file in `posters`:

```sh
mkdir -p png
for f in posters/*.svg; do
  vectorcraft-cli convert "$f" "png/$(basename "$f" .svg).png" --scale 2 || echo "failed: $f" >&2
done
```

Each loop goes on to the next file when one fails and names the file that failed. To run recorded steps on each file instead of converting it, use **Batch…** in the **Actions** panel, or `vectorcraft-cli run` with a steps file, as described in [Write command steps for vectorcraft-cli](/apps/vectorcraft/write-command-steps/).

## Check a file with info

`vectorcraft-cli info FILE` opens a file and prints a JSON summary of it without changing it:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli info festival-posters.vectorcraft
```

| Field | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `file` | The file you gave |
| `warnings` | What did not come in as it was, for example an EPS file read from its preview, and why |
| `info` | The title, color mode, units, number of artboards, number of objects, and the file information such as author, description, keywords, and the created and modified dates |
| `artboards` | Each artboard's name and its rectangle as `[x, y, width, height]` in points |
| `kinds` | The number of objects of each kind, such as `Path`, `Ellipse`, `Type` and `Layer`. Ruler guides are not counted. |
| `fonts` | Each font the document uses, whether it is missing, the font used in its place, and how many objects and text runs use it |

Run `info` before a conversion to check which artboard numbers to pick and whether any fonts are missing.

## Measure how fast a file draws with bench

`vectorcraft-cli bench FILE` draws a file and prints how many milliseconds each frame takes:

```sh
vectorcraft-cli bench festival-posters.vectorcraft --size 1920x1080 --iters 10
```

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--size WxH` | `2880x1800` | The size of the frame in pixels. `bench` centers the first artboard in the frame and scales it until its width or its height fills 95% of the frame. |
| `--iters N` | `5` | How many frames are drawn and averaged for each measurement |

`bench` measures the drawing twice, first with several threads and then with a single thread (`threads 0`), and prints a line for each. Before each measurement it draws one frame that is not timed.

```text
festival-posters.vectorcraft: 142 nodes, 2880x1800
  threads 8: 8.2 ms/frame (drawn 82, culled 59)
  threads 0: 11.3 ms/frame (drawn 82, culled 59)
```

`drawn` counts the objects that were drawn and `culled` counts the objects that were skipped because they lie outside the frame. A file with no artboard stops with the error `document has no artboard`.

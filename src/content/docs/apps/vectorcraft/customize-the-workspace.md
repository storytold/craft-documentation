This guide covers how to set up the VectorCraft window: workspaces, panels, bars and toolbars, the Help Bar, holding a tool's key to use the tool for a moment, the edges and widgets drawn over the artwork, document windows, saved views, the Navigator panel, Rotate View, screen modes and Presentation Mode, and the History panel. The theme, accent color and language are set in [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/).

## Switch workspaces

A workspace is a saved arrangement of the bars, the Tools panel and the panels. VectorCraft starts in Essentials.

1. Choose **Window → Workspace**, or click the workspace switcher at the right end of the menu bar. The switcher shows the name of the current workspace.
2. Click a workspace in the list. The current one has a check mark.

![The Window menu open over a dusk street corner with a lit building, with the Workspace submenu listing Essentials, Essentials Classic, Automation, Layout, Painting, Printing and Proofing, Tracing, Typography, Web and Touch. Essentials is checked, Typography is highlighted, and Reset Essentials, New Workspace… and Manage Workspaces… are at the bottom](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/workspace-switcher.webp)

| Workspace | Control bar | What else it sets up |
|---|---|---|
| **Essentials** | Hidden | Basic toolbar and the Contextual Task Bar |
| **Essentials Classic** | Shown | Rulers, the Advanced toolbar, no Contextual Task Bar, and the Color panel open |
| **Automation** | Shown | The Advanced toolbar, the Layers tab and the Actions panel open |
| **Layout** | Shown | Rulers, the Advanced toolbar, the Layers tab and the Align panel open |
| **Painting** | Shown | The Advanced toolbar in two columns and the Brushes panel open |
| **Printing and Proofing** | Shown | Rulers, the Advanced toolbar and the Info panel open |
| **Tracing** | Shown | The Advanced toolbar, the Layers tab and no Contextual Task Bar |
| **Typography** | Shown | Rulers, the Advanced toolbar and the Character panel open |
| **Web** | Shown | Rulers, the Advanced toolbar and the Symbols panel open |

The list also has a **Touch** workspace for touch screens. When **Enable Touch Workspace** is on in the Devices page of **Edit → Preferences…**, VectorCraft switches to Touch the first time you touch the screen. When VectorCraft switched to Touch on its own, it switches back to the workspace you used before when you turn the preference off. If you chose Touch yourself, VectorCraft stays in Touch. [Work on a touch screen](/apps/vectorcraft/work-on-a-touch-screen/) covers the Touch workspace, the finger gestures and drawing with a pen.

VectorCraft keeps the layout changes you make in each workspace. When you switch away and come back, the panels are where you left them. Switching workspaces does not change the UI brightness.

To put the current workspace back the way it was saved, choose **Window → Workspace → Reset *name***. The item shows the name of the current workspace, for example **Reset Essentials**.

## Arrange panels

The dock runs down the right edge of the window. Its outer column holds the Properties, Layers and Libraries tabs, and the column of icons beside it opens the other panels. Every panel is listed in the **Window** menu. Choose a panel there to show it, and choose it again to hide it. [Panels](/apps/vectorcraft/panels/) lists every panel with what it does and its shortcut.

- To group panels, drag a panel's tab onto another panel group. The panel joins that group as a tab.
- To dock a panel beside a group, drag its tab to the edge of the group. Drop it on the side edge to place it next to the group, or on the top or bottom edge to place it above or below the group in the column.
- To float a panel, drag its tab out of the dock. The panel opens in a window of its own that you can move anywhere.
- To collapse a group to its tabs, double-click a tab or the group's drag bar. In a floating window, the window collapses to its title bar. Double-click again to restore it.
- To collapse the dock to icons, click the double arrow at the top of the dock. Click it again to expand the outer column.
- Click an icon in the column of icons to open its panel in a flyout beside the column. To resize the flyout, drag its edge on the canvas side or its bottom edge. The edge beside the icons stays where it is. The workspace keeps the size you set, and the buttons at the foot of the panel stay at the bottom of a taller flyout.
- Press Tab to hide the panels, the Tools panel and the Control bar, and press Tab again to show them. Press Shift+Tab to hide or show only the panels.

![The Harbor Lights festival poster on the canvas, with the dock rearranged into three groups: the Layers tab open at the top listing the Type, Lanterns, Harbor and Background layers, the Swatches and Color tabs docked below it with Swatches open, and the Brushes and Symbols group collapsed to its tabs at the bottom](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/panel-groups.webp)

In the desktop app, the floating panel windows are hidden while a dialog, a menu, a tool flyout or the All Tools drawer is open. A panel that you float during that time is hidden with them, and it shows with the others when the dialog, menu, flyout or drawer closes.

## Save your own workspace

1. Arrange the bars, the Tools panel and the panels the way you want them.
2. Choose **Window → Workspace → New Workspace…**.
3. Type a name and click **OK**. VectorCraft suggests "Workspace 1," "Workspace 2" and so on.

![The New Workspace dialog over the Harbor Lights poster, with Poster Layout typed in the Name field above the note that the dialog saves the current bars, toolbar and panel layout, and the Cancel and OK buttons below it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/new-workspace-dialog.webp)

The new workspace appears in the Workspace menu below the built-in ones. You cannot use the name of a built-in workspace. If you use the name of one of your own workspaces, the new layout replaces it.

To rename or delete your workspaces, choose **Window → Workspace → Manage Workspaces…**:

1. Click one of your workspaces in the list. The built-in workspaces are dimmed and cannot be changed.
2. To rename it, type the new name in the field and click **Rename**. To delete it, click **Delete**.
3. Click **OK**.

![The Manage Workspaces dialog listing the built-in workspaces from Essentials to Touch in dimmed text, followed by two saved workspaces, Poster Layout and Color Review. Color Review is selected, Color Proofing is typed in the name field, and the New, Rename and Delete buttons sit beside the field](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/manage-workspaces-dialog.webp)

If you delete the workspace you are using, VectorCraft switches to Essentials. To save the current layout as another workspace from the same dialog, type a name in the field and click **New**. You do not need to select a workspace first.

## Show or hide the Control bar, the Help Bar and the Contextual Task Bar

The Control bar runs across the top of the window under the menu bar. The Help Bar runs across the bottom of the window, above the status bar. The Contextual Task Bar floats under the selection on the canvas.

- Choose **Window → Control** to show or hide the Control bar. Essentials hides it, and the other built-in workspaces show it.
- Choose **Window → Help Bar** to show or hide the Help Bar. It shows by default, and each workspace keeps its own setting. Hiding the Help Bar leaves the status bar in place.
- Choose **Window → Contextual Task Bar** to show or hide the task bar.
- To keep the task bar in one place, open its **More Options** menu and choose **Pin Bar Position**. Choose **Reset Bar Position** to put it back under the selection.
- Choose **Window → Tools** to show or hide the Tools panel.

![The Lanterns Sold title selected on a night market sales chart, with the Control bar across the top showing the type's fill, stroke, character and paragraph settings. The Contextual Task Bar under the title has its More Options menu open, listing Hide Bar, Pin Bar Position, Reset Bar Position and Show Properties Panel, with Pin Bar Position highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/task-bar-options.webp)

### Read the Help Bar

The Help Bar shows what the current tool does with each click, drag and key. The keys and actions are in bold. For the Pen tool, it reads **Click** to add a corner point, **Drag** to add a smooth point, **Click the first point** to close and **Enter** to finish. For a tool without hints, the Help Bar names the shortcut for **Help → Search Commands…**, or the menu path when the command has no shortcut.

When a hint is wider than the window, the Help Bar cuts it off with an ellipsis (…). Hold the pointer over the hint to read it in full in a tooltip.

Three anchor points are placed, the next segment previews to the pointer with a distance readout beside it, and the Help Bar above the status bar reads Click to add a corner point, Drag to add a smooth point, Click the first point to close, Enter to finish](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/help-bar.webp)

### Choose what the Control bar shows

The Control bar shows the options for the current tool or selection in groups. To leave a group out of the bar, use the Control bar's panel menu:

1. Click the panel menu button at the right end of the Control bar. The menu lists the groups, with a check mark next to each group that is on.
2. Click a group to turn it off. Click it again to turn it back on.

The menu lists these groups, in this order: Snapping, Anchor Points, Tool Options, Object Options, Image Options, Fill and Stroke, Opacity, Graphic Style, Character, Paragraph, Vertical Alignment, Align and Distribute, Transform, Artboard Options and Document Options.

Every group starts on. A group that is on shows only when the tool or the selection uses it. A group that is off stays out of the bar even when its tool or object is selected, and it takes no room in the bar. VectorCraft keeps your choice with the preferences and with each workspace.

![The top of the window with the lighthouse group selected and the Control bar showing Snapping, Group, the fill and stroke settings, the Align buttons and the Transform fields. The Control bar's panel menu is open at the right end, with Opacity and Graphic Style unchecked, every other group checked, and Dock to Top checked below them](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/control-bar-groups.webp)

The same menu has **Dock to Top** and **Dock to Bottom**, which move the Control bar to the top or the bottom of the window. You can also drag the gripper at the left end of the bar to the top or bottom edge of the window.

## Show or hide edges and widgets on the canvas

The **View** menu has commands that hide or show the marks VectorCraft draws over your artwork. They do not change the artwork. When you choose one, its name in the menu changes from Hide to Show, or from Show to Hide. Everything except the transparency grid and the Live Paint gaps shows by default.

| Command | What it hides or shows |
|---|---|
| **View → Hide Edges** | The paths and anchor points of the selected objects, the highlight under the pointer, and the bounding box, corner widgets, text threads and Live Paint gaps |
| **View → Hide Bounding Box** | The bounding box around the selection. While it is hidden, you cannot drag its handles |
| **View → Show Transparency Grid** | A grid behind the artboards of the current document. Each document has its own setting, and a `.vectorcraft` file keeps it when you save |
| **View → Hide Text Threads** | The lines that join threaded text frames |
| **View → Hide Gradient Annotator** | The Gradient tool's annotator on the canvas |
| **View → Hide Corner Widget** | The corner widgets at the corners of the selected paths |
| **View → Show Live Paint Gaps** | The gaps in the selected Live Paint groups, in each group's gap preview color. The gaps show only while edges show |

![The View menu open over a column graph of lanterns sold per night, with Hide Edges (Ctrl+H) highlighted. The graph is selected, so its bounding box and the anchor points of every bar show, and the lower part of the menu lists Hide Bounding Box, Show Transparency Grid, Hide Text Threads, Hide Gradient Annotator, Hide Corner Widget and Show Live Paint Gaps](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/view-menu-edges.webp)

## Make your own toolbar

The Tools panel comes in two layouts. Choose **Window → Toolbars → Advanced** to switch between the Basic and Advanced layouts, and **Window → Toolbars → Double Column** to show the tools in two columns.

### Edit the Tools panel

1. Click the **•••** button at the bottom of the Tools panel. The All Tools drawer opens beside it. Tools already in the panel are dimmed in the drawer.
2. Drag a tool from the drawer onto the Tools panel. Drop it between two tools to give it a slot of its own, or onto a tool to add it to that tool's group.
3. To remove a tool, drag it from the Tools panel into the drawer.
4. To show or hide the controls under the tools, click a button in the **Show** section at the foot of the drawer: **Fill and Stroke Controls**, **Coloring Controls**, **Draw Mode Controls** or **Screen Mode Controls**. VectorCraft saves these settings with the preferences.
5. Press Esc or click outside the drawer to close it.

![The All Tools drawer open beside the Tools panel over a dusk garden scene with a starry sky, hills and a coral picket fence. The tools already in the Tools panel are dimmed in the drawer, and the pointer rests on the second of the four Show buttons at the foot of the drawer, whose tooltip reads Coloring Controls](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/tools-drawer-show.webp)

The Show section appears only when you open the drawer from the Tools panel. A toolbar made with **New Toolbar…** has no Show section.

To put the Tools panel back the way it ships, open the drawer's menu and choose **Reset**. The menu also has **Basic** and **Advanced** items, which switch the Tools panel between the two layouts. The drawer also lists the tools of the [built-in plug-ins](/apps/vectorcraft/built-in-plug-ins/) under their own headings. To add the Path Precision Tools to the Tools panel, see [Cut, join and refine paths](/apps/vectorcraft/cut-join-and-refine-paths/#add-the-path-plug-in-tools-to-the-tools-panel).

### Make a new toolbar

1. Choose **Window → Toolbars → New Toolbar…**, or choose **New Toolbar…** in the All Tools drawer's menu.
2. Type a name of up to 200 characters and click **OK**. A blank toolbar floats beside the Tools panel.
3. Click the **•••** button at the foot of the new toolbar to open the All Tools drawer beside it.
4. Drag tools from the drawer onto the toolbar.

The Smooth tool is being dragged from the drawer's Draw section, a line under the Eyedropper shows where it will drop, and the Help Bar shows the Eyedropper tool's hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/custom-toolbar.webp)

You can also fill a new toolbar from a menu instead of dragging:

1. Click the **+** button (**Add Tool…**) above the **•••** button. A menu lists every tool under the same headings as the All Tools drawer. The tools already in the toolbar are dimmed.
2. Click a tool to add it at the end of the toolbar.
3. To take a tool out, open the menu again and click the tool under **Remove Tool** at the top of the menu.

The menu scrolls when it is taller than the window. The **+** button also works from the keyboard: when it has the focus, press Enter to open the menu, and press Enter on a tool to add it. Only toolbars made with **New Toolbar…** have the **+** button.

![A floating toolbar over the lighthouse scene with its Pen, Pencil, Paintbrush and Blob Brush tools. Its Add Tool menu is open below the + button and scrolled to the Draw heading, where Pen Tool, Paintbrush Tool, Blob Brush Tool and Pencil Tool are dimmed and Curvature Tool is highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/toolbar-plus.webp)

Drag a toolbar by its title bar to move it. Click the double arrow in the title bar to switch between one and two columns, and click the × to hide it. Each toolbar you make is listed under **Window → Toolbars**, where you can show it again. VectorCraft keeps each toolbar with the workspace you made it in. A workspace can have up to 64 toolbars.

To rename, copy or delete toolbars, choose **Window → Toolbars → Manage Toolbars…**. Select a toolbar and type a new name to rename it, click **+** to make a copy, or click the trash can to delete it. With no toolbar selected, **+** makes a blank toolbar.

## Switch tools for a moment

You can hold down a tool's shortcut key to use that tool and go back to the tool you had before. This works for tools whose shortcut is a single key, such as P for the Pen tool or B for the Paintbrush tool. The **Hold a Tool Shortcut to Use the Tool Temporarily** option in the General page of **Edit → Preferences…** turns this on and off. It is on by default.

1. Hold down the tool's key. The tool becomes the current tool.
2. Use the tool while you hold the key: click, drag, or press Enter to open its dialog.
3. Let go of the key. VectorCraft goes back to the tool you used before.

A quick press chooses the tool and keeps it. VectorCraft treats the key as held when you let go of it 0.25 seconds or more after you pressed it, or when you used the tool while the key was down. If you let go of the key during a drag, VectorCraft goes back to the previous tool when the drag ends.

You can hold a second tool's key while you hold the first. Letting go of the second key goes back to the first key's tool. Choosing another tool in any other way, or switching to another app, ends the hold, and the current tool stays.

With the preference on, a key that you hold down chooses its tool once. With the preference off, the key chooses its tool for good, and each repeat of the held key chooses it again. Holding Space to use the Hand tool works with either setting. See [Keyboard shortcuts](/apps/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts/) for the tool keys.

## Open more windows on a document

Choose **Window → New Window** to open another view of the current document. The new view has its own zoom, position, rotation, artboard and Outline or Preview mode, and it opens as a tab named after the document with the view's number after a colon, for example heron.vectorcraft:2. When the current view floats, the new view opens in a floating window of its own instead. Changes you make in one view show in all of them. Closing the last view closes the document.

To see several documents or views at once, choose a command from **Window → Arrange**:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Cascade** | Puts each open document in a floating window and stacks the windows from the upper left, 30 pt apart |
| **Tile** | Shows every open document and view side by side in a grid, each fitted to its pane. Click in a pane to work in it |
| **Float in Window** | Moves the current document out of the tab strip into a floating window. Dragging a document tab up or down out of the tab strip does the same |
| **Float All in Windows** | Moves every document into a floating window of its own |
| **Consolidate All Windows** | Puts every document back in the tab strip, so one document shows at a time |

![Four panes tiled in the window: the heron scene at 32.81% in heron.vectorcraft:1, a close-up of the heron at 85% in heron.vectorcraft:2, the dusk garden scene, and the Harbor Lights poster. The heron.vectorcraft:2 pane is active and has an orange outline](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/arrange-tile.webp)

To dock one floating document again, drag its window onto the tab strip. VectorCraft does not save the window arrangement. Each document opens in the tab strip.

## Save and return to views

A saved view stores the position, zoom and rotation of the canvas in the document.

1. Zoom, scroll and rotate the canvas to the view you want.
2. Choose **View → New View…**. The dialog suggests the first free name of the form "View 1," "View 2" and so on. Type a name and click **OK**.
3. To go back to the view later, choose its name at the bottom of the **View** menu.

![The bottom of the View menu over a 160% close-up of the heron, with New View… and Edit Views… above three saved views: Whole Scene, Heron Close-up and Reeds and Sun. The pointer rests on Whole Scene](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/saved-views-menu.webp)

A document can have up to 25 saved views, each with a different name.

To rename or delete views, choose **View → Edit Views…**. This command is available once the document has a saved view. Select a view, edit its name or click **Delete**, and click **OK**. All the renames and deletions you make in the dialog are one undo step, and **Cancel** leaves the views as they were.

![The Edit Views dialog with Whole Scene, Heron Close-up and Reeds at Sunset in the Saved Views list. Reeds at Sunset is selected, the Name field shows the new name, and a Delete button sits below the field](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/edit-views-dialog.webp)

To set up and move between artboards, see [Set up a document and artboards](/apps/vectorcraft/set-up-documents-and-artboards/).

## Move around with the Navigator and rotate the view

### Navigator panel

Choose **Window → Navigator**. The panel shows a thumbnail of the document with a red box around the part that the canvas shows.

- Drag the box, or click anywhere in the thumbnail, to move the view there.
- Type a zoom percentage in the field, drag the slider, or click the **Zoom Out** and **Zoom In** buttons on either side of the slider. The slider runs from 3.13% to 64,000%.
- In the panel menu, choose **View Artboard Only** to fit the thumbnail to the artboards. Without it, the thumbnail also takes in artwork that lies outside them.
- Choose **Panel Options…** in the panel menu to set the color of the view box (Light Red by default) and to turn on **Draw Dashed Lines as Solid Lines** for the thumbnail.

![The Navigator Panel Options dialog over a dusk skyline zoomed to 150%, with Color set to Light Red and Draw Dashed Lines as Solid Lines turned off. The Navigator panel below Properties shows the whole skyline with a red box around the part on screen, and its zoom field reads 150%](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/navigator-panel-options.webp)

### Rotate the view

Rotating the view turns the canvas on screen. The artwork itself does not rotate.

1. Press Shift+H to choose the Rotate View tool. It is in the Hand tool's group in the Tools panel.
2. Drag on the canvas. The view turns about the center of the canvas, and a dial at the center shows the angle. Hold Shift to turn in 15° steps.
3. Release the mouse button. The angle shows in the status bar next to the zoom level.

To rotate the view without changing tools, hold Space and Shift and drag.

![The heron illustration turned 30° on the canvas with the Rotate View tool, with a dial at the center of the canvas reading 30°. The Navigator panel below Properties shows the whole artwork with a red view box turned to match, and the status bar shows 30° next to the zoom level of 105%](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/rotate-view.webp)

You can also set the angle from the menus:

- **View → Rotate View** turns the view to a preset angle: 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°, -15°, -30°, -45°, -60° or -90°. The angle menu in the status bar does the same.
- **View → Rotate View to Selection** turns the view to the angle of the selected objects, so the edges of their bounding box line up with the edges of the window. When the selected objects have different angles, the view turns to 0°.
- **View → Reset Rotate View** (**Ctrl+Shift+1**, or **Cmd+Shift+1** on macOS) turns the view back to 0°. With the Rotate View tool chosen, press Esc to do the same. With any other tool, press Esc twice within one second.

## Present your artwork

### Screen modes

Choose **View → Screen Mode**, or press F to cycle through the modes:

| Mode | What shows |
|---|---|
| **Normal Screen Mode** | The VectorCraft window with its menu bar, bars and panels |
| **Full Screen Mode with Menu Bar** | The window fills the screen and keeps the menu bar |
| **Full Screen Mode** | The window fills the screen without the menu bar and the Control bar |

VectorCraft always starts in Normal Screen Mode.

### Presentation Mode

Presentation Mode shows only the canvas, with no menu bar, tabs, panels, toolbars, Help Bar or status bar.

1. Choose **View → Presentation Mode**, or press Shift+F.
2. Press → or click to go to the next artboard. Press ← to go back.
3. Press Esc to leave Presentation Mode.

![The Harbor Lights festival poster in Presentation Mode, filling the screen on a dark background with no menu bar, tabs, panels, toolbars or status bar](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/presentation-mode.webp)

In Presentation Mode, other keys and the tools do not change the document.

## Step back with the History panel

Choose **Window → History**. The panel lists every step you have taken in the current document. The first row, **Open**, is the document as you opened it, and the highlighted row is the current state.

1. Click a row to go back to that step. The steps after it stay in the list, dimmed.
2. Click a dimmed row to go forward to it again.

![The History panel below Properties listing Open, Group, Move, Fill Color and Fill Color, with the second Fill Color highlighted as the current state and the later Fill Color and Rotate rows dimmed. On the canvas, the small sailboat on the Harbor Lights poster is selected with a coral hull and the title is yellow](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/history-panel.webp)

If you make a change after going back, the new step replaces the dimmed steps. The panel menu also has these commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Step Backward** | Undoes one step, as **Edit → Undo** does |
| **Step Forward** | Redoes one step, as **Edit → Redo** does |
| **Clear History** | Removes every undo and redo step of the document. The artwork stays as it is, and you cannot undo the clearing |
| **Set History Limit…** | Opens the Performance page of the preferences, where **History States** sets how many steps are kept (500 by default) |

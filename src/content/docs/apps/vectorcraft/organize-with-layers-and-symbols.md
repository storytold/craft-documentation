This guide shows how to sort a drawing into layers and sublayers, find a layer or object, hide and lock them while you work, and draw over a placed sketch on a template layer. It also shows how to turn art you repeat into a symbol, so that one edit changes every copy, how to share symbols through libraries, and how to spray many copies of a symbol at once.

## Work in the Layers panel

Open the panel with **Window → Layers** (F7). The panel lists layers at the top level, with their sublayers, groups and objects inside them.

![A harbor poster at sunset with the Layers panel listing three layers named Type, Artwork and Background. The Artwork layer is expanded to show its lighthouse, sea and sun, the lighthouse is selected, and the Background layer is locked](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/layers-panel.webp)

Each row in the panel has these parts, from left to right:

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Eye** | Click it to hide or show the row. A template layer shows a template mark here instead of the eye, and a layer in outline view shows a hollow eye with a ring around it. |
| **Lock** | Click it to lock or unlock the row. A locked row shows a lock. |
| **Color bar** | Shows the color of the layer that holds the row. Set the color in **Layer Options**. |
| **Disclosure triangle** | Opens or closes the row to show what it holds. Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) the triangle to open or close every row inside it as well. |
| **Thumbnail** | Shows a small picture of the row's art. Double-click it to open the row's options. |
| **Name** | Double-click the name to rename the row. The name of a clipping path is underlined, and the name of a masked object has a dashed underline. |
| **Target circle** | Click it to target the layer, group or object. A double ring marks the targeted item, or the rows of the selected art when nothing is targeted, and a filled circle marks an item that has an appearance or a transparency of its own. See [Apply an appearance to a whole layer](#apply-an-appearance-to-a-whole-layer). |
| **Selection square** | Click the column at the right end of the row to select the row's art, and Shift-click it to add the art to the selection or take it out. A square in the layer's color shows on a row whose art is selected, and a smaller square shows on a row with selected art inside it. |

A small triangle in the top-right corner of a layer's row marks the current layer.

1. Click **Create New Layer** at the bottom of the panel, or press **Ctrl+L** (**Cmd+L** on macOS). The new layer goes directly above the current layer. Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) the button to put the new layer above every other layer, or Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) it to set the layer's options first.
2. Click a layer's row to make it the current layer. New art you draw goes into the current layer.
3. To add a layer inside another one, click **Create New Sublayer**.
4. Drag a row up or down to change the stacking order, or drop it on another layer to move it there. To move the selected art, drag the small selection square in its row onto another layer.
5. Click the eye column of a row to hide or show it, and click the lock column next to it to lock or unlock it.
6. To find a selected object in the list, click **Locate Object**. The panel opens the layers around the object and scrolls to its row.

The other buttons at the bottom of the panel are **Delete Selection**, which deletes the highlighted rows with everything in them, and **Make/Release Clipping Mask**. **Make/Release Clipping Mask** makes the top object of the layer clip the rest of the layer, and a second click releases it. [Clip a whole layer](#clip-a-whole-layer) gives the steps.

:::tip
Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) a layer's eye to hide every other layer, and Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) its lock to lock every other layer. Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) the eye to switch that one layer between preview and outline view.
:::

To send selected art to the current layer from the canvas, choose **Object → Arrange → Send to Current Layer**.

### Guides on layers

Each ruler guide belongs to a layer or sublayer. A guide you drag out of a ruler goes onto the current layer, above that layer's art. The Layers panel lists the layer's guides at the top of the layer, as **&lt;Horizontal Guide&gt;** or **&lt;Vertical Guide&gt;** rows.

- Click a guide's row to select the guide. Shift-click or Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) a row to add the guide to the selected guides or take it out.
- To move guides to another layer, drag their rows onto that layer's row or onto a row inside that layer. When the row you drag is selected, every selected guide moves.
- Hiding a layer hides its guides, and locking a layer locks them, so you cannot select or drag them.
- Deleting a layer deletes its guides. **Merge Selected** keeps the guides in the merged layer.
- Guides show on the screen only. They are left out of exports.

To make and move guides, see [Use rulers, guides and grids](/apps/vectorcraft/set-up-documents-and-artboards/#use-rulers-guides-and-grids).

## Show, hide and lock several rows with one drag

You can show, hide, lock or unlock many rows with one drag.

1. Press the mouse button on the eye of the first row you want to change. That row switches between shown and hidden.
2. Keep the button down and drag down the eye column over the other rows. Each row the pointer passes takes the same state as the first row.
3. Release the button. The whole drag is one undo step.

Drag down the lock column in the same way to lock or unlock several rows.

Modifier keys change what a click on the eye or the lock does. Each of these clicks is one undo step.

| Click | On the eye | On the lock |
|---|---|---|
| Click | Hides or shows the row. | Locks or unlocks the row. |
| Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) | **Hide Others**: hides every other top-level layer. When every other layer is already hidden, **Show All Layers** shows every layer. | **Lock Others**: locks every other top-level layer. When every other layer is already locked, **Unlock All Layers** unlocks every layer. |
| Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) | Switches the layer between preview and outline view. | |
| Ctrl+Alt-click (Cmd+Option-click on macOS) | **Outline Others**: puts every other top-level layer in outline view and this row's layer in preview. When every other layer is already in outline view, **Preview All Layers** puts every layer in preview. | |

## Apply an appearance to a whole layer

When you target a layer, the appearance, effect and transparency commands change the layer itself instead of each object in it. An effect on the layer then applies to all the art in the layer together.

1. Click the target circle at the right of the layer's row. The circle shows a double ring, the layer becomes the current layer, and the layer's visible, unlocked art is selected, including the art in its sublayers.
2. Open the Appearance panel with **Window → Appearance** (**Shift+F6**). The panel lists **Layer** at the top.
3. Choose an effect from the **Effect** menu, such as **Effect → Stylize → Feather…**, or set an opacity or a blend mode in the Transparency panel. The change goes onto the layer, and the target circle fills to show that the layer has an appearance of its own.
4. To stop targeting the layer, select something else. Any other change to the selection ends the targeting.

![The harbor-at-dusk poster with four coral and peach clouds over the violet sky. The Clouds layer is targeted in the Layers panel, with a filled target circle and a selection square, every cloud shows its selection outline, and the Appearance panel above the Layers panel lists Layer, Contents, Feather and Opacity: Default.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/organize-with-layers-and-symbols-target-layer.webp)

You can also target a group or an object with its target circle. Shift-click a target circle to add that item to the selection, or to take it out when all of it is already selected. A Shift-click does not target anything.

To move or copy an appearance from one row to another:

- Drag a target circle onto the target circle of another row. That row gets the fills, strokes, effects, opacity and blend mode of the first row, and the first row's appearance is cleared.
- Alt-drag (Option-drag on macOS) the target circle to copy the appearance instead. The first row keeps its appearance.
- Drag a target circle onto **Delete Selection** at the bottom of the panel to clear that row's appearance. An object keeps one empty fill and stroke, a group keeps no fill or stroke of its own, and the opacity and blend mode are reset.

Opacity masks stay where they are when you move or copy an appearance. For more on building an appearance, see [Apply effects and appearance](/apps/vectorcraft/apply-effects-and-appearance/).

## Clip a whole layer

A clipping layer shows its art only inside one shape, its clipping path. The steps below turn the top object of a layer into that shape.

1. Put the shape you want to clip with at the top of the layer. It must be a path, a compound path or a text object.
2. Click the layer's row to highlight it.
3. Click **Make/Release Clipping Mask** at the bottom of the Layers panel, or choose **Make/Release Clipping Mask** from the panel menu. The top object becomes the clipping path: it loses its fill and stroke, moves to the bottom of the layer, and its name is underlined. The rest of the layer shows only inside it.
4. To release the clipping mask, highlight the layer and click **Make/Release Clipping Mask** again. The layer stops clipping, and the clipping path stays in the layer without a fill or stroke.

![A porthole view: a navy porthole frame with amber bolts on a teal hull, and inside the round window a dusk seascape with a violet sky, a coral sun, teal waves and a navy boat with an amber sail. The Layers panel shows the View layer open with Window, the underlined clipping path, at the bottom of the layer, and the tooltip Make/Release Clipping Mask shows over the button at the bottom of the panel.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/organize-with-layers-and-symbols-clip-layer.webp)

The command acts on the one highlighted layer or group row. When no single layer or group row is highlighted, it acts on the one selected group, and otherwise on the current layer. Art you add to a clipping layer later is clipped too.

When the top object is not a path, a compound path or a text object, VectorCraft shows "the top object must be a path, compound path or text object to use as a clipping mask" and does not change the layer. A layer with no objects shows "the layer has no objects to clip by".

To clip selected objects with a shape instead of a whole layer, see [Clip art with a clipping mask](/apps/vectorcraft/combine-and-cut-shapes/#clip-art-with-a-clipping-mask).

## Find a layer or object

In a document with many layers, the search field and the filter at the top of the Layers panel shorten the list.

1. Type part of a name into the **Search All** field. The panel keeps the rows whose names contain that text, together with the layers and groups that hold them, and shows those rows open.
2. To list only some kinds of rows, click **Filter** at the right of the search field. Under **By Object**, select **Paths**, **Shapes**, **Text**, **Images**, **Effects**, **Groups**, **Linked Files** or **Guides**. Under **By Layer**, select **Locked** or **Hidden**. A row stays when it matches the search text, one of the kinds you selected and one of the states you selected. A section with nothing selected keeps every row. The **Filter** button stays highlighted while a filter is on.
3. To see every row again, clear the search field and click **Clear All** in the filter list.

The search and the filter change only what the panel lists. They do not change the document, the rows you opened or the selection.

You can also choose **Locate Object** from the panel menu to find the row of an object you selected on the canvas. When the search, the filter or **Show Layers Only** hides that row, the panel cannot show it and does not open any rows. To have the panel find each object you select on the canvas, turn on **Locate Selected Objects** in **Layers Panel Options**, described below.

## Set layer options

Double-click a layer's thumbnail, or the empty part of its row, to open **Layer Options**. Double-clicking the name itself lets you rename the layer in place. You can also choose **Options for Selection…** from the panel menu.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Sets the name shown in the Layers panel. |
| **Color** | Sets the layer's color from a list of presets, or from **Custom** for any color. |
| **Template** | Makes the layer a template layer. A template layer is locked, its images are dimmed to 50%, and it is left out of printing and export. Turning **Template** off unlocks the layer and stops the dimming. |
| **Show** | Shows or hides the layer. |
| **Preview** | Draws the layer's art in full. With **Preview** off, the layer's art is drawn in outline. |
| **Dim Images to** | Dims the layer's placed images on the canvas to the percentage you enter. |
| **Lock** | Locks the layer, so its art cannot be selected. |
| **Print** | Includes the layer when the document prints. |

**Lock** and **Print** cannot be changed while **Template** is on. When you open **Layer Options** for a group or an object instead of a layer, the dialog shows only the name, **Show** and **Lock**.

## Change how the Layers panel looks

Choose **Panel Options…** from the Layers panel menu to open **Layers Panel Options**, set the options, and click **OK**. The panel keeps these settings for every document.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Show Layers Only** | Lists layers and sublayers only, without the groups and objects inside them. Off by default. |
| **Locate Selected Objects** | When you select an object on the canvas or with a command, the panel opens the layers around it and scrolls to its row without highlighting the row. Off by default. |
| **Row Size** | Sets the height of each row: **Small** (20 pt), **Medium** (26 pt) or **Large** (40 pt). Choose **Other** to enter a height from 12 to 100 pt. **Medium** is the default. |
| **Thumbnails** | **Layers**, **Group** and **Object** show or hide the thumbnail on each kind of row. All three are on by default. |

## Trace over a template layer

1. Choose **File → Place…** (**Ctrl+Shift+P**, or **Cmd+Shift+P** on macOS) and pick the sketch or photo you want to draw over.
2. Turn on **Template** in the **Place** dialog, then place the file. The image goes onto a new locked template layer directly below the current layer. The new layer is named **Template** followed by the file name.
3. Click the layer above the template to make it current, and draw over the image.
4. Choose **View → Hide Template** (**Ctrl+Shift+W**, or **Cmd+Shift+W** on macOS) to see your drawing without the image. The same menu item, now named **Show Template**, shows the template again.

:::note
Template layers do not print and are left out of export. A template layer made with **Place** shows its image at full strength. To fade the image, double-click the template layer's thumbnail, turn on **Dim Images to** in **Layer Options**, and enter a percentage.
:::

## Use the Layers panel menu

The panel menu holds commands that work on whole layers. Most of them act on the highlighted rows, or on the current layer when no row is highlighted.

- **Merge Selected** moves the contents of two or more highlighted rows into the row you highlighted last.
- **Flatten Artwork** moves the art of every visible top-level layer into one layer.
- **Collect in New Layer** moves the highlighted rows, or the selected objects, into a new layer.
- **Release to Layers (Sequence)** puts each object of a layer or group into a sublayer of its own. **Release to Layers (Build)** does the same, but each new sublayer also holds copies of the objects below it.
- **Reverse Order** reverses the stacking order of the highlighted rows.
- **Template** turns the highlighted layers into template layers, or back into ordinary layers.
- **Hide Others**, **Outline Others** and **Lock Others** act on every top-level layer except the ones that hold the highlighted rows, or the current layer when no row is highlighted. When every other layer is already hidden, in outline or locked, the menu shows **Show All Layers**, **Preview All Layers** or **Unlock All Layers** in that item's place, and the command shows, previews or unlocks every layer.

[Move, copy and merge layers](/apps/vectorcraft/rearrange-and-merge-layers/) gives the steps for merging, collecting, releasing, reversing and flattening layers. **Enter Isolation Mode** in the same menu is described in [Edit in isolation mode](/apps/vectorcraft/edit-in-isolation-mode/).

:::caution
**Flatten Artwork** deletes hidden layers and the art in them. Show any layer you want to keep before you flatten. Template layers are kept.

## Make and place symbols

A symbol is art stored once in the document. Each copy of it on the canvas is an instance, and every instance changes when you edit the symbol. Open the panel with **Window → Symbols** (**Ctrl+Shift+F11**, or **Cmd+Shift+F11** on macOS).

![Seven teal leaves of different sizes and angles along a branch with two glowing lanterns, all instances of one symbol. One leaf is selected, and the Symbols panel shows the leaf symbol's thumbnail](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/symbols-panel.webp)

1. Select the art you want to reuse.
2. Click **New Symbol** at the bottom of the Symbols panel, or press **F8**. In **Symbol Options**, enter a name and click **OK**. The art is saved as a symbol, and the selection on the canvas becomes its first instance. You can also drag selected art onto the panel. Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) **New Symbol** to skip **Symbol Options** and make a dynamic symbol under the next free name, such as **New Symbol 2**.
3. To place another instance, drag the symbol from the panel onto the canvas. The instance is centered where you drop it. **Place Symbol Instance** places one at the center of the artboard.
4. Move, scale and rotate instances like any other object.

| Action | Where |
|---|---|
| **New Symbol** | Symbols panel button, **New Symbol…** in the panel menu, or **F8** |
| **Place Symbol Instance** | Symbols panel button or panel menu, or drag a symbol onto the canvas |
| **Edit Symbol** | Double-click an instance on the canvas or the symbol in the panel, or choose **Edit Symbol** in the panel menu |
| **Redefine Symbol** | Panel menu: replaces the symbol's art with the selected art |
| **Duplicate Symbol** | Panel menu: adds a copy of the symbol chosen in the panel, named after it with **copy** at the end |
| **Delete Symbol** | Symbols panel button or panel menu: deletes the symbol chosen in the panel. VectorCraft asks before it deletes a symbol that has no instances; Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) the button to delete it without asking. For a symbol with instances, click **Expand Instances** to turn them into ordinary art, or **Delete Instances** to remove them. |
| **Symbol Options…** | Panel menu: opens **Symbol Options** for the symbol chosen in the panel |
| **Replace Symbol** | Panel menu, or the **Replace** menu on the Control bar while instances are selected |
| **Break Link to Symbol** | Symbols panel button or panel menu: turns the selected instances into plain art |
| **Reset Symbol Instance** | Panel menu: removes the appearance changes made to the selected instances of a dynamic symbol |
| **Reset Transformation** | Panel menu, or **Reset** on the Control bar while instances are selected: gives the selected instances their symbol's own size again, without rotation, shear or reflection. Each instance keeps the center of its bounding box in place. |
| **Select All Instances** | Panel menu: selects every instance of the symbol chosen in the panel |
| **Select All Unused** | Panel menu: selects the symbols that have no instances. **Delete Symbol** then deletes all of them after one question. |
| **Sort by Name** | Panel menu: puts the symbols in alphabetical order. See [Sort and view symbols](#sort-and-view-symbols). |
| **Thumbnail View**, **Small List View**, **Large List View** | Panel menu: shows the symbols as thumbnails or as a list. See [Sort and view symbols](#sort-and-view-symbols). |

## Set symbol options

**Symbol Options** opens when you make a new symbol. To change the options of an existing symbol, click it in the Symbols panel and choose **Symbol Options…** from the panel menu.

![The Symbol Options dialog over rounded plum, coral and teal buttons on a night sky. It shows the name Button, Export Type Graphic, Dynamic Symbol, the center registration point, and Enable Guides for 9-Slice Scaling turned on with Left 15%, Top 30%, Right 15% and Bottom 30%, while the wide Book a table button is selected behind it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/symbol-options.webp)

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Sets the symbol's name. A new symbol starts with the next free name, such as **New Symbol** or **New Symbol 2**. The name cannot be empty. |
| **Export Type** | Marks the symbol as a **Movie Clip** or a **Graphic**. A new symbol is a **Movie Clip**. |
| **Symbol Type** | **Dynamic Symbol** lets each instance change the appearance of parts of the art and stay linked to the symbol. **Static Symbol** turns this off. A new symbol is dynamic. |
| **Registration** | Sets the registration point to one of nine points on the art's bounding box. A new symbol uses the center. |
| **Enable Guides for 9-Slice Scaling** | Adds two horizontal and two vertical guides that cut the symbol into nine parts. When you scale an instance, the corners keep their size, the top and bottom parts stretch only in width, the left and right parts stretch only in height, and the center stretches both ways. |
| **Left**, **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom** | Set how far each guide sits from its own edge, as a percentage of the symbol's size, from 0 to 100. Each guide starts at 25%. |

To move the 9-slice guides by hand, open the symbol in symbol editing mode. The guides show as dotted lines with any tool. With the Selection Tool, drag a guide to move it. A guide stays inside the art's bounding box and stops before the guide opposite it. Press **Esc** during the drag to put the guide back.

## Edit a symbol

1. Double-click an instance on the canvas with the Selection Tool, or double-click the symbol in the Symbols panel. VectorCraft opens the symbol's art in symbol editing mode.
2. Change the art. Each change appears in every instance of the symbol.
3. Click **Exit Symbol Editing Mode** on the Control bar to return to the document.

![All seven Leaf instances on the teal branch are yellow after the Leaf symbol was edited, and the selected instance shows its bounding box. The Control bar shows Symbol with Replace set to Leaf, and the Symbols panel shows the yellow Leaf thumbnail.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/symbol-update.webp)

:::tip
To change one instance without changing the others, select it and click **Break Link to Symbol**. The instance becomes ordinary art that you can edit on its own.
:::

### Change a part of one instance

In an instance of a dynamic symbol, you can change the look of one part of the art for that instance only, and the instance stays linked to the symbol. The symbol's **Symbol Type** must be **Dynamic Symbol**.

1. Select the Direct Selection Tool and click a path, compound path or type object inside the instance. VectorCraft outlines that part. To select the whole instance instead, hold Alt (Option on macOS) or Shift while you click.
2. Change the part's fill or stroke to a solid color, a gradient or a pattern, or set its opacity and blend mode in the Transparency panel. You can also click another object with the Eyedropper Tool to copy its fill and stroke onto the part.
3. To change another part, click it and repeat step 2. Each change is one undo step.

Only the fill, stroke, opacity and blend mode of a path, compound path or type part can change this way. When you edit the symbol later, the instance keeps each change whose part is still in the symbol's art. To remove the changes, select the instance and choose **Reset Symbol Instance** from the Symbols panel menu.

## Sort and view symbols

The Symbols panel menu sets the order of the document's symbols and how the panel shows them.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sort by Name** | Puts the symbols in alphabetical order, ignoring upper and lower case, as one undo step. It needs at least two symbols. When the symbols are already in order, nothing changes and no undo step is added. |
| **Thumbnail View** | Shows each symbol as a thumbnail. This is the default view. |
| **Small List View** | Shows each symbol in a row with a small thumbnail and its name. |
| **Large List View** | Shows each symbol in a taller row with a larger thumbnail and its name. |

The menu shows a check mark next to the current view. In every view, click a symbol to make it the current symbol, and double-click it to edit it.

## Load and save symbol libraries

A symbol library is a set of symbols that you can add to any document. VectorCraft includes five libraries, and you can save your own.

| Library | Symbols |
|---|---|
| **Basic Shapes** | Filled shapes with an outline: Circle, Square, Rounded Square, Triangle, Diamond, Hexagon, Star, Burst and Arrow |
| **UI Frames** | **Panel**, **Button** and **Bar** for interface mock-ups. Each one has 9-slice guides turned on, so an instance keeps the size of its rounded corners when you scale it wider or taller. When you make an instance smaller than its two corners on one axis, the corners shrink as well. |
| **Map Markers** | Pin, Flag, Crosshair and Checkpoint |
| **Inventory Icons** | Sword, Shield, Potion, Key and Gem |
| **Skill Icons** | Attack, Defend, Heal, Buff and Ult |

To use a library:

1. Choose **Window → Symbol Libraries**, then a built-in library such as **UI Frames**, or one of your libraries under **User Defined**. To use the symbols of another VectorCraft document, choose **Other Library…** and pick the file. You can also open a library with **Open Symbol Library** in the Symbols panel menu. The library opens in a panel of its own.
2. Click a symbol in the library panel to add it to the document's Symbols panel. Or drag the symbol onto the canvas to add it and place an instance where you drop it. A symbol the document already has is not added again, and a symbol whose name another symbol already uses gets a number, such as **Star 2**.

The card is being dragged wider by its right handle with a W: 226.00 pt readout and keeps its rounded corners. The Symbols panel, docked above the Properties panel, is in Large List View and lists Panel, Button and Bar](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/symbols-ui-frames.webp)

:::tip
The symbols in the built-in libraries are static. To give each instance its own colors, as the buttons above have, choose **Symbol Options…** for the symbol, set **Symbol Type** to **Dynamic Symbol**, and change each instance's parts as [Change a part of one instance](#change-a-part-of-one-instance) describes.
:::

To save the document's symbols as a library:

1. Choose **Save Symbol Library…** from the Symbols panel menu, or choose **Window → Symbol Libraries → Save Symbols…**.
2. In **Save Symbol Library**, enter a **Name**. It starts as the document's name.
3. Under **Save To**, choose **User Defined Libraries** to list the library under **Window → Symbol Libraries → User Defined**, or **A File…** to save a `.vectorcraft` file in a folder you choose.
4. To save only the symbol you clicked in the Symbols panel, turn on **Selected Symbols Only**. The number after the option shows how many symbols it saves.
5. Click **OK**.

## Spray and adjust symbols

The Symbol Sprayer Tool (Shift+S) paints many instances of the symbol chosen in the Symbols panel as you drag, and removes instances of that symbol when you Alt-drag (Option-drag on macOS). The other symbolism tools are in the same tool group and change the instances under the brush.

1. In the Symbols panel, click the symbol you want to spray.
2. Select the Symbol Sprayer Tool (Shift+S).
3. Drag across the canvas. Instances appear inside the brush circle as you drag, and the whole drag is one undo step. The instances go into a new group named **Symbol Set**.
4. To add instances to a set you already sprayed, select the set with the Selection Tool, switch back to the Symbol Sprayer Tool, and drag again.
5. To remove instances of the chosen symbol, Alt-drag (Option-drag on macOS) over them. With a set selected, the tool removes instances from that set only.

![A night field with a moonrise and a drifting band of glowing firefly symbols. The Symbol Sprayer's brush circle sits at the end of the band, where the newly sprayed fireflies show their selection boxes, and the Symbols panel shows the Firefly symbol](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/symbol-sprayer.webp)

| Tool | What it does when you drag | With Alt (Option on macOS) |
|---|---|---|
| **Symbol Shifter Tool** | Moves instances in the direction you drag. | |
| **Symbol Scruncher Tool** | Pulls instances toward the pointer. | Pushes them apart. |
| **Symbol Sizer Tool** | Makes instances larger. | Makes them smaller. |
| **Symbol Spinner Tool** | Rotates instances in the direction you drag. | Rotates them the other way. |
| **Symbol Stainer Tool** | Tints instances with the current fill color. | Removes the tint. |
| **Symbol Screener Tool** | Makes instances more transparent. | Makes them more opaque. |
| **Symbol Styler Tool** | Applies a graphic style to instances. | Removes the style. |

Double-click any symbolism tool to open **Symbolism Tools Options**, where **Diameter**, **Intensity** and **Symbol Set Density** set the brush that all eight tools share. VectorCraft keeps the brush when you switch tools and saves it with your preferences.

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Diameter** | Sets the width of the brush circle, in the document's units. The default is 80 pt. |
| **Intensity** | Sets how strongly the Shifter, Scruncher, Sizer, Spinner, Stainer, Screener and Styler tools change the instances, from 1 to 10. The default is 5. |
| **Symbol Set Density** | Sets how closely the Symbol Sprayer Tool packs the instances it adds, from 1 to 10. The default is 5. |

While a symbolism tool is active, press **[** or **]** to make the brush smaller or larger, and **Shift+[** or **Shift+]** to lower or raise **Intensity**.

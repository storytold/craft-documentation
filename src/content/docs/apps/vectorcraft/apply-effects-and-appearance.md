An object in VectorCraft can have more than one fill and stroke, and live effects such as shadows, rounded corners and warps. This guide shows how to build that stack in the Appearance panel, apply and edit effects from the Effect menu, and save the result as a graphic style that you can apply to other objects with one click.

## Build a look in the Appearance panel

**Window → Appearance** (**Shift+F6**) lists everything that paints the selected object: its strokes and fills, the effects on each of them and on the whole object, and its opacity. The top row in the panel paints last, in front of the rows below it.

1. Select an object and press **Shift+F6** to open the Appearance panel.
2. Press **Ctrl+/** (**Cmd+/** on macOS) to add a new fill, or **Ctrl+Alt+/** (**Cmd+Option+/** on macOS) to add a new stroke. The buttons at the bottom of the panel do the same: **Add New Stroke** and **Add New Fill**.
3. Click the swatch in a row to pick one of the document's swatches, or Shift-click it to mix a color in the Color panel. A stroke row also has a **Weight** field.
4. Drag a row up or down to change the order. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) while you drag to copy the row instead of moving it.
5. Click the eye at the left of a row to hide that row without deleting it. Click it again to show the row.

The following screenshot shows a teal badge with a thin dark stroke, a wide yellow stroke behind it and a drop shadow, as the Appearance panel lists them.

![A teal badge reading OPEN LATE with a thin dark stroke, a wide yellow stroke behind it and a drop shadow. It is selected, and the Appearance panel lists its two strokes, its fill, the Drop Shadow effect and its opacity](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/appearance-panel.webp)

The buttons at the bottom of the panel act on the selected object or row:

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Add New Stroke** | Adds a stroke on top of the object's stack |
| **Add New Fill** | Adds a fill on top of the object's stack |
| **Add New Effect** | Opens a menu of effects to apply |
| **Clear Appearance** | Leaves the object one fill and one stroke, both set to None, and resets its opacity |
| **Duplicate Selected Item** | Copies the selected fill or stroke row with its effects, or the selected effect row |
| **Delete Selected Item** | Removes the selected fill, stroke or effect row |

![The Appearance panel for the selected FERRY sign, with the Add New Effect menu open below its buttons. Stylize is highlighted in the list of effect groups, and its submenu lists Round Corners, Scribble, Drop Shadow, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, Feather and Glowing Edges, with Drop Shadow highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/appearance-add-effect-menu.webp)

The panel menu has **Reduce to Basic Appearance**, which keeps one fill and one stroke and removes every effect.

![The Appearance panel menu open beside the selected FERRY sign, with Reduce to Basic Appearance highlighted. The menu also lists Add New Fill, Add New Stroke, Duplicate Item, Remove Item, Clear Appearance, New Art Has Basic Appearance (checked), Hide Thumbnail, Redefine Graphic Style, Show All Hidden Attributes and Float Panel](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/appearance-panel-menu.webp)

:::tip
Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) or Shift-click rows to select several fills and strokes, then click **Duplicate Selected Item** or **Delete Selected Item** once for all of them.
:::

## Apply a live effect

Effects in VectorCraft stay live. The object keeps its original path, and VectorCraft draws the effect from that path each time the canvas redraws. You can change or remove an effect at any time.

1. Select an object.
2. Choose an effect from the **Effect** menu, for example **Effect → Stylize → Drop Shadow…**.
3. Change the settings in the dialog. **Preview** is on when the dialog opens, so the canvas shows the result while you change the values.
4. Press **OK**.

![A teal FERRY sign selected over a lighthouse harbor at dusk, with a drop shadow previewed below and to the right of it. The Drop Shadow dialog shows Multiply mode, opacity 75, X and Y 14 px, blur 10 px, the color #000000 with a black swatch beside the field, and Preview turned on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/drop-shadow-dialog.webp)

In the Drop Shadow dialog, choose **Color** or **Darkness** for the shadow. With **Color**, the shadow is the color in the field beside it, black by default. Double-click the swatch next to the field to open the Color Picker over the dialog; its **OK** puts the picked color in the field. With **Darkness**, the shadow uses the object's own colors darkened by the percentage you set, from 0% to 100%, and the swatch is dimmed. Outer Glow and the other effects with a color field have the same swatch.

To change an effect later, select the object and double-click the effect's row in the Appearance panel, or click its name. The dialog opens with the current values.

To apply an effect to one fill or stroke only, click that row in the Appearance panel first, then choose the effect. Without a selected row, the effect applies to the whole object.

![A sun badge in the harbor sky whose wide amber stroke is cut into zigzag rays. In the Appearance panel, the 34 pt amber stroke row is selected and expanded with Zig Zag listed under it, between the thin dark stroke above and the fill below](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effect-on-stroke.webp)

:::note
If you choose an effect that the object already has, VectorCraft asks whether to edit the applied effect or add another one. **Edit** opens the existing effect; **Add New** applies a second copy.
:::

![The prompt "Drop Shadow is already applied" with the buttons Add New, Cancel and Edit, over the selected FERRY sign](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effect-already-applied.webp)

The following image shows the same star with six different live effects. Each star still has its original five-point path.

![Six copies of the same coral star in a dusk sky above teal hills and a harbor, each labeled with its one live effect: a drop shadow, rounded corners, a zigzag edge, a bloated shape, an arc warp and a Gaussian blur. The zigzag star is selected with its original five-point path showing, and the Appearance panel lists its stroke, fill, Zig Zag effect and opacity](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effects-gallery.webp)

### The Effect menu

The top of the Effect menu has four commands:

- **Apply Last Effect** applies the last effect again with the same settings.
- **Last Effect…** opens the dialog of the last effect, where you can change the settings before you apply it. Both commands are dimmed while nothing is selected, and until you have applied an effect from its dialog since VectorCraft started. Editing an effect that is already applied does not change the last effect.
- **Document Raster Effects Settings…** sets the resolution and other options for raster effects.
- **Refresh Deferred Effects** redraws the effects from [plug-ins](/apps/vectorcraft/built-in-plug-ins/) that VectorCraft left undrawn. While a document is on screen, its plug-in effects share 2,000 ms of drawing time, and each plug-in run has a 5,000 ms limit. When an effect does not finish in time or fails, VectorCraft draws the object without it until you choose Refresh Deferred Effects, change the effect or its object, or export. The command is dimmed when no effect is waiting, and it is not an undo step. An export runs every plug-in effect.

Under the **Vector Effects** heading, the menu lists 3D and Materials, Color Adjustments, Color Effects, Convert to Shape, Crop Marks, Distort & Transform, Path, Path Effects, Pathfinder, Rasterize…, Stylize, SVG Filters and Warp. Under the **Raster Effects** heading, it lists the Effect Gallery… and pixel-based groups such as Artistic, Blur and Sketch.

The **Stylize** group under Vector Effects holds **Round Corners…**, **Scribble…**, **Drop Shadow…**, **Inner Glow…**, **Outer Glow…** and **Feather…**.

![The Effect menu open over a harbor scene with a teal FERRY sign selected. At the top are the dimmed Apply Last Effect and Last Effect…, then Document Raster Effects Settings… and the dimmed Refresh Deferred Effects. Under Vector Effects, Stylize is highlighted and its submenu lists Round Corners, Scribble, Drop Shadow, Inner Glow, Outer Glow and Feather, with Drop Shadow highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effect-menu.webp)

### Vector effects at a glance

The following table lists every group under the **Vector Effects** heading and the effects in it. A command whose name ends in "…" opens a dialog. A command without "…" applies the effect at once.

| Group | Effects |
|---|---|
| **3D and Materials** | Extrude & Bevel…, Revolve…, Inflate…, Rotate…; **Materials…** is listed but dimmed; the **3D (Classic)** submenu holds Extrude & Bevel (Classic)… |
| **Color Adjustments** | Brightness/Contrast…, Curves…, Hue/Saturation…, Levels…, Shift to Color…, Temperature/Tint… |
| **Color Effects** | Desaturate, Duotone…, Exposure…, Invert Colors, Vector Halftone… |
| **Convert to Shape** | Rectangle…, Rounded Rectangle…, Ellipse… |
| **Crop Marks** | A single command that adds trim marks around the object's bounds |
| **Distort & Transform** | Free Distort…, Pucker & Bloat…, Roughen…, Transform…, Tweak…, Twist…, Zig Zag… |
| **Path** | Offset Path…, Outline Object, Outline Stroke |
| **Path Effects** | Dashes to Geometry…, Add Anchors…, Extend Path…, Close Path…, Smooth Anchors…, Retract Handles…, Reverse Direction, Simplify Anchors…, Split at Anchors… |
| **Pathfinder** | Add, Intersect, Exclude, Subtract, Minus Back, Divide, Trim, Merge, Crop, Outline, Hard Mix, Soft Mix, Trap… |
| **Rasterize…** | A single command that draws the object as an image, with its own resolution and background settings |
| **Stylize** | Round Corners…, Scribble…, Drop Shadow…, Inner Glow…, Outer Glow…, Feather… |
| **SVG Filters** | Apply SVG Filter…, Import SVG Filter…, then the document's own SVG filters by name; see [Apply an SVG filter](#apply-an-svg-filter) |
| **Warp** | Arc…, Arc Lower…, Arc Upper…, Arch…, Bulge…, Shell Lower…, Shell Upper…, Flag…, Wave…, Fish…, Rise…, Fisheye…, Inflate…, Squeeze…, Twist… |

### Common effects

When you add one of these effects, its dialog opens with these values. After you confirm a warp once, the Arc dialog opens with the warp settings you last confirmed.

| Effect | Menu path | Defaults |
|---|---|---|
| **Drop Shadow** | **Effect → Stylize → Drop Shadow…** | Multiply mode, 75% opacity, X and Y offset 7 pt, blur 5 pt, black |
| **Round Corners** | **Effect → Stylize → Round Corners…** | Radius 10 pt |
| **Outer Glow** | **Effect → Stylize → Outer Glow…** | Screen mode, 75% opacity, blur 5 pt, yellow |
| **Feather** | **Effect → Stylize → Feather…** | Radius 5 pt |
| **Offset Path** | **Effect → Path → Offset Path…** | Offset 10 pt, miter joins, miter limit 4 |
| **Zig Zag** | **Effect → Distort & Transform → Zig Zag…** | Size 10 pt, 4 ridges per segment, smooth points |
| **Pucker & Bloat** | **Effect → Distort & Transform → Pucker & Bloat…** | 0%; negative values pucker and positive values bloat, from -200% to 200% |
| **Arc** | **Effect → Warp → Arc…** | Bend 50%, horizontal |
| **Gaussian Blur** | **Effect → Blur → Gaussian Blur…** (under Raster Effects) | Radius 5 pt |

:::note
When you export a PDF or expand the appearance, VectorCraft draws Drop Shadow, Outer Glow, Feather and Gaussian Blur as images. **Effect → Document Raster Effects Settings…** sets the resolution they use: Screen (72 ppi), Medium (150 ppi), High (300 ppi), or Other for any value from 1 to 2400 ppi.
:::

![The Document Raster Effects Settings dialog with the Resolution list open on Screen (72 ppi), Medium (150 ppi), High (300 ppi) and Other. Below it are Color Model, Background, Anti-alias, Create Clipping Mask, Add 0 px Around Object and Preserve Spot Colors](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/raster-effects-settings.webp)

## Apply raster effects with the Effect Gallery

Raster effects work on the pixels of the object's image at the resolution that **Document Raster Effects Settings…** sets. They stay live in the same way as vector effects. The **Raster Effects** part of the Effect menu has ten groups:

| Group | Effects |
|---|---|
| **Artistic** | Colored Pencil…, Cutout…, Dry Brush…, Film Grain…, Fresco…, Neon Glow…, Paint Daubs…, Palette Knife…, Plastic Wrap…, Poster Edges…, Rough Pastels…, Smudge Stick…, Sponge…, Underpainting…, Watercolor… |
| **Blur** | Gaussian Blur…, Radial Blur…, Smart Blur… |
| **Brush Strokes** | Accented Edges…, Angled Strokes…, Crosshatch…, Dark Strokes…, Ink Outlines…, Spatter…, Sprayed Strokes…, Sumi-e… |
| **Distort** | Diffuse Glow…, Glass…, Ocean Ripple… |
| **Pixelate** | Color Halftone…, Crystallize…, Mezzotint…, Pointillize… |
| **Sharpen** | Unsharp Mask… |
| **Sketch** | Bas Relief…, Chalk & Charcoal…, Charcoal…, Chrome…, Conté Crayon…, Graphic Pen…, Halftone Pattern…, Note Paper…, Photocopy…, Plaster…, Reticulation…, Stamp…, Torn Edges…, Water Paper… |
| **Stylize** | Glowing Edges… |
| **Texture** | Craquelure…, Grain…, Mosaic Tiles…, Patchwork…, Stained Glass…, Texturizer… |
| **Video** | De-Interlace…, NTSC Colors |

You can choose any of these from its group in the menu. To try several filters together and stack them, use the Effect Gallery, which holds the Artistic, Brush Strokes, Distort, Sketch, Stylize and Texture groups:

1. Select the artwork. With nothing selected, VectorCraft shows "Select artwork to apply effects" and the gallery does not open.
2. Choose **Effect → Effect Gallery…**.
3. Click a group under **Categories**, then click a filter under **Filters**. The filters in each group are listed in alphabetical order, each with a thumbnail.
4. Click **Add to Stack**, or double-click the filter. It appears under **Applied Filters**, and its values appear under **Settings** at the top of the dialog.
5. Change the values under **Settings**. To change another filter in the stack, click its name under **Applied Filters**.
6. Add more filters in the same way. In each **Applied Filters** row, click the eye to hide the filter, the arrows to move it up or down, or **Remove** to take it out.
7. Leave **Preview**, at the bottom of the dialog, turned on to see the stack on the canvas, then press **OK**.

**OK** adds each filter in the stack to the object as a separate effect, in the stack's order, and you can undo the whole stack in one step. A filter that you hid in the stack is added hidden. After that, each filter has its own row in the Appearance panel, where you can change it like any other effect.

Each thumbnail in the **Filters** list shows the filter with its default settings on a small sample landscape. The **Preview** area at the top of the dialog shows the same landscape at a larger size, with the filters in the stack that are not hidden. While the stack is empty, it shows the filter you clicked in the list. The names of the filters it shows are listed under it.

![The Effect Gallery open over a harbor with a white and coral sailboat and a pier under a violet sky, the art's edges rippled by the preview. The Preview area shows a small sample landscape with Ocean Ripple, Settings shows Ripple Size 9 and Ripple Magnitude 9, and the Distort filters Diffuse Glow, Glass and Ocean Ripple are listed with a thumbnail each, with Ocean Ripple selected and the one row under Applied Filters](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effect-gallery-thumbs.webp)

The following screenshot shows the Effect Gallery beside a harbor illustration, with Watercolor added to the stack and previewed on the art.

![A harbor at dusk with a striped lighthouse, a light beam, a setting sun, teal hills and blue water, softened and grainy from the Watercolor preview. The Effect Gallery at the right shows the sample landscape in its Preview area with Watercolor named under it, Brush Detail 3, Shadow Intensity 4 and Texture 3 under Settings, the Artistic filters with a thumbnail each and Watercolor selected, Watercolor as the one row under Applied Filters, and Preview turned on at the bottom](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/effect-gallery.webp)

To paint strokes with brushes instead of a filter, see [Paint with brushes](/apps/vectorcraft/paint-with-brushes/).

## Apply an SVG filter

An SVG filter is an SVG `<filter>` element that VectorCraft applies as a live effect. It works on the object's pixels at the resolution that **Document Raster Effects Settings…** sets. Each document has its own list of SVG filters. **Effect → SVG Filters** has **Apply SVG Filter…** and **Import SVG Filter…**, followed by the document's filters by name. Click a filter's name in that submenu to apply it to the selection at once.

To apply a filter from the dialog:

1. Select the object.
2. Choose **Effect → SVG Filters → Apply SVG Filter…**.
3. Click a filter in the list. If the document has no filters yet, click **New** to write one, or **Import…** to add the filters of an SVG file.
4. Press **OK**. The filter becomes a live effect on the object, with its own row in the Appearance panel.

To write or change a filter:

1. In the Apply SVG Filter dialog, click **New**, or select a filter and click **Edit**. Double-clicking a filter's name also opens it. A code box opens under the list.
2. Type or change the `<filter>` element. Its `id` attribute is the name that the list and the menu show.
3. Click **Save** to add the filter, or to replace the filter you are editing. Click **Cancel** under the code box to close it without saving.

While the code box is open, **New**, **Edit**, **Delete**, **Import…** and **OK** are dimmed.

![The Apply SVG Filter dialog spans the window over a night poster titled NIGHT STAR, listing Night Haze, Paper Grain, Ripple, Shadow Lift and Soft Glow with Soft Glow selected and its filter code open above Save and Cancel, while New, Edit, Delete, Import… and OK are dimmed. Below the dialog, the large coral star is selected between an amber star with a shadow and a glowing magenta star over teal hills](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/svg-filter-dialog.webp)

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New** | Opens an empty code box for a new filter; dimmed when the document has 64 filters |
| **Edit** | Opens the selected filter's code; dimmed until a filter is selected |
| **Delete** | Removes the selected filter from the document at once; dimmed until a filter is selected |
| **Import…** | Adds the filters of an SVG file and selects the first one added |
| **Save** | Adds the filter in the code box, or replaces the filter you are editing; dimmed while the code box is empty |
| **Cancel** (under the code box) | Closes the code box without saving |
| **OK** | Applies the selected filter; dimmed until a filter is selected |

A filter holds 1 to 64 filter primitives and at most 64 KB of code, and no two filters in a document can have the same name. **Import…** and **Effect → SVG Filters → Import SVG Filter…** read SVG files of up to 16 MB, but not compressed `.svgz` files, and take at most the first 256 filters of a file. A filter whose name the document already has is left out.

When you save a change to a filter, every object that uses it changes. When you delete a filter, those objects keep the effect, but it draws nothing until you save or import a filter of the same name again.

To swap the filter on one object, select the object and double-click the SVG filter's row in the Appearance panel, or click its name. The dialog opens with that object's filter selected. Click another filter and press **OK** to put it in place of the applied one. If the filter was deleted from the document, its name appears dimmed above the list. If the effect names a filter that the document does not hold but carries the filter's code, for example in a file you opened, the dialog opens with that code in the code box as a new filter, and **Save** adds it to the document.

## Blend, repeat and distort objects

Blends, repeats and envelopes stay live in the same way as effects: you can change the original objects at any time and the result updates.

- **Object → Blend → Make** (**Ctrl+Alt+B**, or **Cmd+Option+B** on macOS) fills the space between two selected objects with steps that change smoothly from one to the other. **Object → Blend → Blend Options…** sets the **Spacing**: **Smooth Color**, **Specified Steps** or **Specified Distance**.
- **Object → Repeat** repeats the selection in a **Radial**, **Grid** or **Mirror** pattern that updates as you edit the original.
- **Object → Envelope Distort** bends artwork, type included, with **Make with Warp…**, **Make with Mesh…** or **Make with Top Object**, which uses the shape on top.

[Make patterns, blends and repeats](/apps/vectorcraft/make-patterns-blends-and-repeats/) covers blends and repeats in full, and [Reshape with the warp tools](/apps/vectorcraft/reshape-with-warp-tools/) covers Envelope Distort and the tools that push and twist paths.

The following screenshot shows three ribbons made with blends. One blend is selected with its two key paths showing.

![Three wide ribbons blended across a dusk sky over a harbor: amber to coral, teal to violet, and coral to gold. The teal ribbon is selected with its two key paths showing, and the Layers panel lists the three blends in the Ribbons layer above the Hills and Sky layers](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/blends.webp)

## Add 3D

**Effect → 3D and Materials** has **Extrude & Bevel…**, **Revolve…**, **Inflate…** and **Rotate…**. **Revolve…** spins a profile around an axis, so the outline of half a vase becomes a whole vase. While the dialog is open, drag the rings on the canvas to turn the object, and use the **Lighting** tab to light it.

![A still life of a teal vase, a coral bowl, a lavender sphere and an amber bottle made with Revolve, on a navy table against a dusk sky. The vase is selected with rotation rings drawn over it, and the Revolve dialog shows its Rotation tab with the revolve angle, axis side, offset, cap and view settings](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/revolve.webp)

The other three commands work on the object's own outline:

- **Extrude & Bevel…** uses the art as the front face and extrudes it backward, so a word or a flat shape becomes a solid block. A bevel shapes its front edges.
- **Inflate…** rounds the shape outward, so its edges curve like the edges of a cushion.
- **Rotate…** turns the flat art in 3D without adding depth. Every fill and stroke keeps its paint.

![A lavender cloud over the harbor, rounded into a puffy 3D shape with rotation rings drawn over it. The Inflate dialog shows its Object tab with Depth 0.0 px, Twist 0.0°, Taper 100.0%, Cap Solid, Volume 50.0% and Both sides turned off](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/inflate.webp)

To extrude an object:

1. Select the object, for example a line of type.
2. Choose **Effect → 3D and Materials → Extrude & Bevel…**. The dialog opens on its **Object** tab, and rings appear over the object on the canvas.
3. Set the **Depth**, and pick a **Bevel Shape** if you want a beveled edge.
4. Drag the rings to turn the object. Hold **Shift** while you drag to turn it in steps of 15°. You can also pick a position from **Presets** on the **Rotation** tab.
5. On the **Lighting** tab, choose a lighting preset or change the light.
6. Press **OK**.

The following screenshot shows the word LANTERN extruded 50 px deep with a Classic bevel, over a night skyline.

![The word LANTERN in heavy amber letters, extruded into solid blocks and turned in 3D over a night sky with stars, a pale moon and a purple skyline of lit windows. Rotation rings are drawn over the selected type, and the Extrude & Bevel dialog shows its Object tab with Depth 50.0 px, Twist 0.0°, Taper 100.0%, Cap Solid and Bevel Shape Classic](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/extrude-bevel.webp)

Extrude & Bevel and Inflate have three tabs: **Object**, **Rotation** and **Lighting**. Rotate has only **Rotation** and **Lighting**. **Reset all**, at the bottom of the dialog, puts every setting back to its default.

| Setting | Tab | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Depth** | Object | 50 pt (Extrude & Bevel), 0 pt (Inflate) | How far the object extends back, from 0 to 2000 pt |
| **Twist** | Object | 0° | Turns the back against the front, from 0° to 360° |
| **Taper** | Object | 100% | The size of the back compared with the front, from 1% to 100% |
| **Cap** | Object | Solid | **Solid** closes the object; **Hollow** leaves it open |
| **Bevel Shape** | Object (Extrude & Bevel) | None | **None**, **Classic**, **Rounded**, **Cove**, **Step** or **Ogee** |
| **Width**, **Height** | Object (Extrude & Bevel) | 4 pt | The size of the bevel, from 0 to 1000 pt |
| **Repeat**, **Space** | Object (Extrude & Bevel) | 1, 0% | How many times the bevel repeats (1 to 32), and the flat space between repeats (0% to 90%) |
| **Bevel Inside**, **Bevel both sides** | Object (Extrude & Bevel) | Off | Cuts the bevel into the shape instead of adding it around the shape, and bevels the back as well as the front |
| **Volume** | Object (Inflate) | 50% | How round the edge is, from 0% to 100%; 50% rounds it like half a sphere |
| **Both sides** | Object (Inflate) | Off | Inflates the back as well; off leaves the back flat |
| **Presets** | Rotation | Off-Axis Front | Sixteen positions, from **Front** to **Isometric Bottom** |
| **Rotation X**, **Y**, **Z** | Rotation | -21.88°, -23.4°, 9.06° | The angle around each axis, from -180° to 180° |
| **Perspective** | Rotation | 0° | 0° shows no perspective; a wider angle brings the eye nearer, up to 160° |
| **Shading** | Lighting | On | Shades the surfaces by the lights |
| **Presets** | Lighting | Standard | **Standard**, **Diffuse**, **Top Left** or **Right** |
| **Add Light**, **Delete Light** | Lighting | One light | Up to 10 lights; each has its own **Color**, **Intensity** (80%), **Rotation**, **Height** (30°) and **Softness** (0%) |
| **Ambient Light** | Lighting | 25% | Light that reaches every surface, from 0% to 200% |
| **Light behind the object** | Lighting | Off | Lights the object from behind |

**Width**, **Height**, **Repeat**, **Space**, **Bevel Inside** and **Bevel both sides** are dimmed while **Bevel Shape** is **None**. The **Depth**, **Width** and **Height** fields show their values in the document's unit, so a document set to pixels shows the default depth as 50.0 px.

[Make 3D artwork](/apps/vectorcraft/make-3d-artwork/) covers the 3D and Materials panel, 3D on groups and type, and **Effect → 3D and Materials → 3D (Classic) → Extrude & Bevel (Classic)…**.

## Make the appearance permanent

**Object → Expand Appearance** turns the selected object's appearance into ordinary objects:

- Each fill and stroke becomes an object of its own, grouped in paint order.
- Effects that change the shape, such as Zig Zag or Round Corners, are applied to the paths.
- Raster effects such as shadows, glows and blurs become embedded images.
- Hidden fills, strokes and effects are dropped.

![The FERRY sign after Expand Appearance, with its yellow outer stroke and its dark shadow now separate objects. The selection box is larger than the sign because it includes the margin around the shadow image. The Layers panel shows the Sign layer holding a selected group of three paths and a Raster effect image](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/expand-appearance.webp)

:::caution
After Expand Appearance, the effects are no longer live and you cannot change their settings in the Appearance panel. Keep a copy of the object, for example on a hidden layer, if you may need to edit the effects later.
:::

## Save and reuse a graphic style

A graphic style stores an object's whole appearance: its fills, strokes, effects, opacity and blend mode. **Window → Graphic Styles** (**Shift+F5**) lists the styles in the document.

1. Select an object that has the look you want to keep.
2. In the Graphic Styles panel, press **New Graphic Style**. Alt-click the button (Option-click on macOS) to name the style as you make it.
3. Select another object and click the style in the panel to apply it.

An object that you apply a style to stays linked to that style. Alt-click a style (Option-click on macOS) to add its fills, strokes and effects on top of the object's existing appearance instead; this unlinks the object. Double-click a style to open **Graphic Style Options…**.

The following image shows a style saved from one rectangle and applied to the other two.

![Three teal buttons labeled Tickets, Map and Food under the heading Harbor Night Market, sharing the same strokes and shadow. The Food button is selected, and the Graphic Styles panel shows the new style as its last, highlighted thumbnail](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/graphic-styles.webp)

**Window → Graphic Style Libraries** opens the bundled sets of styles. The panel menu also has **Open Graphic Style Library** and **Save Graphic Style Library…**.

![The Shadows and Glows library open below the Graphic Styles panel, beside the selected FERRY sign. It lists Soft Shadow, Hard Shadow, Lifted Card, Halo, Neon Tube, Inner Light, Ember, Feathered and Haze](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/graphic-style-library.webp)

:::tip
If you click a style while nothing is selected, VectorCraft uses that style for the next object you draw.

This guide covers the tools for menus, brochures and other documents with a lot of text: paragraph and character styles, OpenType features and glyphs, tab stops, text wrap, find and replace, special spaces and breaks, vertical type, hyphenation and justification, and the Type Tools plug-in. [Add and style type](/apps/vectorcraft/add-and-style-type/) covers making type and setting its font, size and alignment. [Make lists and fit type to its frame](/apps/vectorcraft/make-lists-and-fit-type/), [Check spelling](/apps/vectorcraft/check-spelling/) and [Set type in other languages](/apps/vectorcraft/set-type-for-other-languages/) cover lists, spelling and type in other languages.

## Save formatting as paragraph and character styles

A style is a named set of attributes. When you change a style, every paragraph or character that uses it changes too. VectorCraft has two kinds:

| Kind | What it holds | Panel |
|---|---|---|
| Paragraph style | Paragraph attributes: alignment, indents, space before and after, tab stops, lists, hyphenation, justification and the composer | **Window → Type → Paragraph Styles** |
| Character style | Character attributes: font, size, leading, kerning, tracking, case, position, color and OpenType features | **Window → Type → Character Styles** |

A paragraph style does not hold a font or a color. To give headings or dish names their own font and color, save those as a character style and use it together with the paragraph style.

Each panel lists the Normal style first, as **[Normal Paragraph Style]** or **[Normal Character Style]**. The style of the selected text is highlighted.

To make a paragraph style:

1. Format one paragraph with the Paragraph panel and the Tabs panel.
2. Choose the Type tool (T) and click in that paragraph.
3. In the Paragraph Styles panel, click **Create New Paragraph Style** at the bottom of the panel. The new style is named Paragraph Style 1, Paragraph Style 2 and so on. To name it as you make it, Alt-click the button (Option-click on macOS). **New Paragraph Style…** in the panel menu makes the style with the next default name, the same as a plain click on the button.

Alt-clicking the button opens the **New Paragraph Style** dialog. Besides the name, it has the same sections as **Paragraph Style Options…**, filled in from the paragraph you clicked in. See [Edit a paragraph style's options](#edit-a-paragraph-styles-options).

To make a character style, select the characters with the Type tool, then do the same in the Character Styles panel. A new style takes the attributes of the first selected character. Alt-click **Create New Character Style** (Option-click on macOS) to name it as you make it. **New Character Style…** in the panel menu gives it the next default name, Character Style 1, Character Style 2 and so on.

The following screenshot shows a two-column menu card with the dish name Scallion pancake selected with the Type tool. The Paragraph Styles panel lists the Normal style and the Heading, Dish and Price styles, with Dish highlighted.

![A two-column night market menu card on a dark indigo background with a string of lanterns across the top. The dish name Scallion pancake in the right column is highlighted as a Type tool selection, and the Paragraph Styles panel lists Normal Paragraph Style, Heading, Dish and Price, with Dish highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paragraph-styles.webp)

## Apply and update a style

1. Select type objects with the Selection tool, or select text with the Type tool. A paragraph style applies to every paragraph that the selection touches.
2. Click the style in the Paragraph Styles or Character Styles panel.

When the selected text differs from its style, a plus sign follows the style's name, for example **Dish+**. To apply a style and remove those local changes, Alt-click the style (Option-click on macOS), or click it and choose **Clear Overrides** from the panel menu.

To change a style and every paragraph that uses it:

1. Change the formatting of one paragraph that uses the style.
2. With the caret in that paragraph, select the style in the panel and choose **Redefine Paragraph Style** from the panel menu. Text that has its own overrides keeps them.

![A night market menu card with the caret in the dish name Scallion pancake, which has extra space above it. The Paragraph Styles panel shows Dish+ highlighted, and its panel menu is open with Redefine Paragraph Style under the pointer](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paragraph-style-overrides.webp)

The panel menu holds these commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New Paragraph Style…** or **New Character Style…** | Makes a style from the selected text |
| **Duplicate Paragraph Style** or **Duplicate Character Style** | Copies the highlighted styles |
| **Delete Paragraph Style** or **Delete Character Style** | Deletes the highlighted styles; the text keeps its look. The Normal style cannot be deleted |
| **Select All Unused** | Highlights the styles that no text uses |
| **Clear Overrides** | Removes the local changes from the selected text |
| **Redefine Paragraph Style** or **Redefine Character Style** | Takes the selected text's attributes into the style |
| **Paragraph Style Options…** | Edits the style's name and its paragraph attributes in five sections: **General**, **Basic Paragraph Formats**, **Composition**, **Hyphenation** and **Justification**. See [Edit a paragraph style's options](#edit-a-paragraph-styles-options) |
| **Character Style Options…** | Edits the style in five sections: **General**, **Basic Character Formats**, **Advanced Character Formats**, **Character Color** and **OpenType Features** |
| **Load Paragraph Styles…** or **Load Character Styles…** | Adds the styles of that kind from a document you pick, with the swatches and patterns they use. A style whose name the document already uses for a different style is added under a new numbered name |
| **Load All Styles…** | Adds both the character and the paragraph styles of a document you pick |

Shift-click a style to highlight a range of styles, or Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) to add one. Highlighting a style this way does not apply it to the text. You can also drag a style onto the **Create New** button to duplicate it, or onto the trash button to delete it.

## Edit a paragraph style's options

**Paragraph Style Options…** changes a paragraph style, and every paragraph that uses it, in one step.

1. In the Paragraph Styles panel, double-click the style. You can also highlight only that style and choose **Paragraph Style Options…** from the panel menu. The Normal style has no options.
2. Click a section in the dialog's section list: **General**, **Basic Paragraph Formats**, **Composition**, **Hyphenation** or **Justification**.
3. Change the fields. With **Preview** on, which is the default, the paragraphs that use the style show the change on the canvas while the dialog is open.
4. Click **OK**. The change is one undo step. Text that has its own overrides keeps them.

![The Paragraph Style Options dialog on its Basic Paragraph Formats section, over a three-column harbor newsletter with a lighthouse and sailboats at dusk across the top and the coral masthead The Harbor Light partly behind the dialog. Alignment is Justify with last line aligned left, Left Indent 0 pt, First-line Left Indent 12 pt and Space After Paragraph 6 pt, with Right Indent and Space Before Paragraph empty. The Paragraph Styles panel at the top right lists Normal Paragraph Style, Body Text, Masthead and Pull Quote, with Body Text highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paragraph-style-options.webp)

An empty field leaves that attribute out of the style, so each paragraph keeps its own value. A checkbox has three states: click it once to turn it on, again to turn it off, and a third time to leave it empty. In the **Hyphenation** and **Justification** sections, an empty field takes its default value once any other field of the same section is set. **Reset Panel** empties every field of the section that shows. It is not available on **General**.

| Section | Options |
|---|---|
| **General** | **Style Name**, and a list of every attribute the style sets |
| **Basic Paragraph Formats** | **Alignment**: **Auto** aligns each paragraph to the start of its direction (left for left-to-right text, right for right-to-left text), or pick one of the Paragraph panel's seven alignments. **Left Indent**, **Right Indent**, **First-line Left Indent**, **Space Before Paragraph** and **Space After Paragraph**, from -1296 to 1296 pt |
| **Composition** | **Composition**: **Single-line Composer** or **Every-line Composer**. **Roman Hanging Punctuation** |
| **Hyphenation** | **Hyphenation** turns hyphenation on or off. **Words Longer Than**, **After First**, **Before Last**, **Hyphen Limit**, **Hyphenation Zone** and **Hyphenate Capitalized Words**, which are available while **Hyphenation** is on. **Hyphenation Zone** also needs **Single-line Composer** in the **Composition** section |
| **Justification** | **Word Spacing**, **Letter Spacing** and **Glyph Scaling**, each with **Minimum**, **Desired** and **Maximum** in percent. **Auto Leading** in percent. **Single Word Justification**: **Full Justify**, **Align left**, **Align center** or **Align right** |

The **Hyphenation** and **Justification** sections take the same ranges and defaults as the **Hyphenation…** and **Justification…** dialogs. See [Fine-tune justification and hyphenation](#fine-tune-justification-and-hyphenation). When a spacing row is out of order, the dialog shows "Minimum must not exceed Desired, nor Desired Maximum." below the fields, and **OK** leaves the dialog open until you fix the row. A value outside its range shows a message in the same place. The dialog has no tab stops: to change a style's tab stops, set them on a paragraph and choose **Redefine Paragraph Style**.

## Use OpenType features and glyphs

The OpenType panel (**Window → Type → OpenType**; **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T**, or **Cmd+Option+Shift+T** on macOS) turns on the extra features of an OpenType font for the selected text. A feature changes the text only when the font has it.

| Control | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Figure** | **Default Figure**, **Tabular Lining**, **Proportional Lining**, **Proportional Oldstyle**, **Tabular Oldstyle** |
| **Position** | **Default Position**, **Superscript**, **Subscript**, **Numerator**, **Denominator** |
| Check boxes | **Standard Ligatures**, **Contextual Alternates**, **Discretionary Ligatures**, **Swash**, **Stylistic Alternates**, **Titling Alternates**, **Small Caps**, **Ordinals**, **Fractions** |
| **Stylistic Sets** | The numbered sets the font has. You can turn on more than one |

Tracked text does not use ligatures, and the panel shows "Ligatures are off while the text is tracked." **Reset OpenType Features** in the panel menu turns every feature back to the default.

![The price 5.50 in the right column of a night market menu card is selected with the Type tool. The OpenType panel shows Figure set to Proportional Oldstyle, Position set to Default Position, and Standard Ligatures and Contextual Alternates turned on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/opentype-panel.webp)

The Glyphs panel (**Type → Glyphs** or **Window → Type → Glyphs**) shows every character in the font of the selected text.

1. With the Type tool, click where the character should go.
2. In the Glyphs panel, pick a group of characters from **Show**: **Entire Font**, **Basic Latin**, **Latin-1 Supplement**, **Latin Extended**, **Punctuation**, **Currency & Symbols** or **Greek & Cyrillic**.
3. Double-click the character. It goes in at the caret. With type objects selected instead, it goes at the end of their text.

![The letter g in the dish name Mango sticky rice is selected with the Type tool on a night market menu card. The Glyphs panel shows Basic Latin characters of Source Sans 3 Semibold, with the g highlighted in the grid](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/glyphs-panel.webp)

To swap a letter for an alternate form, select the letter with the Type tool and choose **Alternates for Current Selection** from **Show**. Double-click an alternate to replace the letter. The **−** and **+** buttons make the previews smaller or larger, and **Use the Selected Text's Font** in the panel menu returns the panel to the font of the selected text after you browse another font.

![The Glyphs panel with Show set to Alternates for Current Selection lists three forms of the g selected in Mango sticky rice: the default g, a single-story g and a small capital G](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/glyph-alternates.webp)

## Set tab stops

Tab stops line up text after a tab character, for example prices at the right edge of a menu column.

1. Select a type object, or click in a paragraph with the Type tool.
2. Choose **Window → Type → Tabs** (**Ctrl+Shift+T**, or **Cmd+Shift+T** on macOS).
3. Click the ruler to add a stop. Drag a stop to move it, or drag it off the ruler to delete it.
4. With the stop selected, click an alignment button: **Left-Justified Tab**, **Center-Justified Tab**, **Right-Justified Tab** or **Decimal-Justified Tab**.
5. Type the exact position in **X**, and the characters that fill the gap before the stop in **Leader**, for example a period and a space. A leader repeats up to eight characters.
6. For a decimal tab, type the character to line up on in **Align On**. The default is a period.

![The Tabs panel floats just above the right column of a night market menu, with its ruler running from 0 at the column's left edge past the selected right-justified stop at 400 px, which is highlighted in red directly over the right edge of the prices 8.75, 5.50, 4.50 and 6.00. The Right-Justified Tab button is on, X reads 400 px, Leader and Align On each hold a period, and the caret sits in the line crispy, soy dip, where dot leaders run to the price](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/tabs-panel-leaders.webp)

Stops are measured from the left edge of the text, or of the frame for area type. A stop lands on the nearest whole point. Hold Shift while you drag, or turn on **Snap to Unit** in the panel menu, to land on the ruler's ticks. Ctrl-drag a stop (Cmd-drag on macOS) to move every stop by the same distance. The ruler's indent markers set **First-line Left Indent** and **Left Indent**.

The panel menu also holds **Clear All Tabs**, **Delete Tab** and **Repeat Tab**. The **Above Text** button moves the panel so that it floats just above the selected text. In vertical type, the position field is **Y**, and the left and right stops are named **Top-Justified Tab** and **Bottom-Justified Tab**.

## Wrap text around an object

Text wrap makes area type flow around an object, such as an illustration placed inside a column.

1. Put the object on the same layer as the area type, above it in the stacking order.
2. Select the object and choose **Object → Text Wrap → Make**. Area type below the object in the stacking order flows around it, with a gap of 6 pt.
3. To change the gap, choose **Object → Text Wrap → Text Wrap Options…**, set the options and click **OK**.

| Option | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Offset** | The distance between the text and the object, from -1000 to 1000 pt | 6 pt |
| **Invert** | Flows the text inside the object's shape instead of around it | Off |

To stop the wrap, select the object and choose **Object → Text Wrap → Release**. The object stays where it is.

![The Text Wrap Options dialog with Invert off and Offset set to 9, over the right column of a menu card. A coral lantern sits at the top right of the left column, and the opening paragraph flows around the lantern's left side](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/text-wrap.webp)

## Find and replace text

1. Choose **Edit → Find and Replace…**.
2. Type the text to look for in **Find** and the new text in **Replace**.
3. Turn on **Match Case** to match capital and lowercase letters exactly, and **Whole Word** to skip matches inside longer words. With **Whole Word** on, "noodle" does not match "noodles."
4. Click **OK**.

VectorCraft replaces every match in every type object of the document in one step, which **Edit → Undo** reverses. It skips hidden or locked type, type inside a hidden or locked group, type on hidden or locked layers, and type on locked artboards. A match must lie inside text with one set of character attributes, so a word that changes font or color partway through is not found.

With **Whole Word** on, a change of font or color inside a word does not split the word. If "noodles" has its last letter in another color, "noodle" still does not match it.

In VectorCraft 0.24.1, **Edit → Find Next** does not search. Choosing it from the menu shows the error "invalid parameters for `edit.findNext`: missing `find`". To find text, use **Edit → Find and Replace…**.

![The Find and Replace dialog with Find set to noodle, Replace set to ramen, Match Case off and Whole Word on, open over the lanterns of a night market menu card. Below it, with nothing selected, the left column lists Lantern noodle bowl and Sesame noodle salad, and the right column starts with Garlic butter noodles](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/find-replace.webp)

## Insert spaces and breaks

**Type → Insert Whitespace Character** and **Type → Insert Break Character** add a character that is hard to type. VectorCraft adds it at the end of the text of each selected type object.

| Submenu | Characters |
|---|---|
| **Insert Whitespace Character** | **Em Space**, **En Space**, **Hair Space**, **Sixth Space**, **Thin Space**, **Nonbreaking Space**, **Figure Space**, **Punctuation Space**, **Third Space**, **Quarter Space** |
| **Insert Break Character** | **Forced Line Break**, **Tab** |

![The right column of a night market menu card is selected, and the Type menu is open with the Insert Whitespace Character submenu listing Em Space, En Space, Hair Space, Sixth Space, Thin Space, Nonbreaking Space, Figure Space, Punctuation Space, Third Space and Quarter Space](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/insert-whitespace-menu.webp)

These commands do not insert at the caret. The Glyphs panel does not list space characters, so you cannot place one of these spaces at the caret from there either.

**Type → Insert Inline Symbol** places a symbol inside the text as one character, so it moves with the words around it:

1. In the Symbols panel, select the symbol.
2. With the Type tool, click where the symbol should go.
3. Choose **Type → Insert Inline Symbol**.

The symbol is drawn as tall as the font size, centered on the capital letters. Backspace or Delete removes it as one character.

## Set vertical type

In vertical type, each line runs from top to bottom.

1. In the toolbar, choose the Vertical Type tool, the Vertical Area Type tool or the Vertical Type on a Path tool from the Type tool's group.
2. Click or drag on the artboard and type, as with the horizontal tools.

To turn type you already made, select it and choose **Type → Type Orientation → Vertical**. **Type → Type Orientation → Horizontal** turns it back.

The tate-chu-yoko commands set a short run, such as a two-digit number, upright across the column. They appear once the East Asian options are on:

1. Choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**, or **Cmd+K** on macOS). On the **Type** page, under **Language Options**, turn on **Show East Asian Options**. On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → Type…** instead.
2. With the Type tool, select the characters in vertical type.
3. In the Character panel menu, choose **Tate-chu-yoko**. The characters stand side by side across one em of the column.
4. To nudge the block, choose **Tate-chu-yoko Settings…** from the same menu. A positive **Up/Down** moves it up and a positive **Left/Right** moves it right, from -1296 to 1296 pt.

![A lantern festival poster with the vertical banner OPEN 18 TO 24 down its left edge and the number 18 selected with the Type tool. The Character panel menu is open with Tate-chu-yoko checked and Tate-chu-yoko Settings… below it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/tate-chu-yoko-menu.webp)

**Standard Vertical Roman Alignment** in the same menu sets Latin letters and digits upright, one below the other, instead of rotated. Tate-chu-yoko and Standard Vertical Roman Alignment do not change horizontal type.

[Set type in other languages](/apps/vectorcraft/set-type-for-other-languages/) covers the other East Asian options, the language of type and composite fonts.

## Fine-tune justification and hyphenation

The Paragraph panel menu holds **Justification…**, **Hyphenation…** and the choice of composer. They apply to the paragraphs of the selected type, or to those the Type tool's selection touches.

**Single-line Composer** breaks each line on its own. **Every-line Composer**, the default, sets the line breaks of the whole paragraph together. To switch the selected paragraphs between the two, press **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C** (**Cmd+Option+Shift+C** on macOS). **Hyphenation Zone** works only with the Single-line Composer.

To turn hyphenation on, turn on **Hyphenate** in the Paragraph panel, or press **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H** (**Cmd+Option+Shift+H** on macOS). The **Hyphenation…** dialog sets which words break and where:

| Option | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Hyphenation** | Turns hyphenation on or off for the paragraphs, as **Hyphenate** in the Paragraph panel does | Off |
| **Words Longer Than** | Only words with more letters than this break, from 1 to 25 letters | 5 |
| **After First** | The fewest letters before the hyphen, from 1 to 15 | 3 |
| **Before Last** | The fewest letters after the hyphen, from 1 to 15 | 3 |
| **Hyphen Limit** | The most lines in a row that end with a hyphen, from 0 to 25; 0 sets no limit | 0 |
| **Hyphenation Zone** | A line whose text already ends this close to the right edge moves the next word down instead of breaking it, from 0 to 1296 pt | 0 |
| **Hyphenate Capitalized Words** | Allows breaks in words that start with a capital letter. Words in capitals only never break | On |

![The Hyphenation dialog with Hyphenation on, Words Longer Than 5, After First 3, Before Last 3, Hyphen Limit 0, Hyphenation Zone 0 px and Hyphenate Capitalized Words on, open over a night market menu card whose selected left column is justified](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/hyphenation-dialog.webp)

The **Justification…** dialog sets spacing as a percentage. **Desired** applies to every line. **Minimum** and **Maximum** limit how far justified lines may go to fill the width. Minimum must not exceed Desired, and Desired must not exceed Maximum. While a row is out of order, the dialog shows the warning "Minimum must not exceed Desired, nor Desired Maximum." and **OK** is unavailable. Turn on **Preview** to see the spacing on the canvas while the dialog is open.

| Option | What it sets | Range | Defaults (Minimum, Desired, Maximum) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Word Spacing** | The space between words, as a share of the font's word space | 0% to 1000% | 80%, 100%, 133% |
| **Letter Spacing** | Space added after each letter, as a share of a word space | -100% to 500% | 0%, 0%, 0% |
| **Glyph Scaling** | The width of the letters | 50% to 200% | 100%, 100%, 100% |

![The Justification dialog with Word Spacing set to 75%, 100% and 150%, Letter Spacing to 0%, 0% and 10%, Glyph Scaling to 100% in all three columns, Auto Leading to 120%, Single Word Justification to Full Justify and Preview on. The selected, justified left column of a night market menu card shows beside it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/justification-dialog.webp)

The dialog also holds two single settings. **Auto Leading** sets the leading of characters set to Auto, as a share of the font size, from 0% to 500%. The default is 120%. **Single Word Justification** sets how a justified line that holds one word is set: **Full Justify** (the default), **Align left**, **Align center** or **Align right**.

**Type → Optical Margin Alignment** lets punctuation hang outside the margins. Quotation marks, hyphens, periods and commas hang outside fully. Asterisks, tildes, ellipses, dashes, colons and semicolons hang by half, and the letters A, V, W, Y, v, w and y by a tenth of their width. Choose the command again to turn it off. It applies to the selected type and every frame threaded with it.

## Tweak single letters with Text Tweaker

Text Tweaker, part of the built-in Type Tools plug-in, changes one attribute letter by letter from a start value to an end value. The text stays editable.

1. Select type objects, or select characters with the Type tool. At a caret with nothing selected, Text Tweaker changes all of the object's text.
2. Choose **Object → Plug-ins → Type Tools → Text Tweaker…**.
3. Set the options from the following table. Turn on **Preview** to see the change on the canvas.
4. Click **OK**. The change is one undo step.

![The Text Tweaker dialog with Attribute set to Baseline Shift, From 0 pt, To 14 pt, Shape set to Bow, and Skip Spaces and Preview on. Above it, the letters of the heading NIGHT MARKET MENU rise toward the middle of the line and drop again at both ends](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/text-tweaker-baseline.webp)

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Attribute** | **Font Size**, **Baseline Shift**, **Character Rotation**, **Horizontal Scale**, **Vertical Scale**, **Tracking**, **Leading** or **Stroke Weight**. Font Size is the default |
| **From** and **To** | The value of the first and last character. Each attribute starts from its own pair, for example 12 to 36 pt for Font Size and 0° to 30° for Character Rotation. The allowed values are in the next table |
| **Shape** | **Straight** steps evenly, **Ease In Out** starts and ends slowly, **Bow** curves from the From value up to the To value in the middle and back, **Spike** does the same in straight lines, and **Random** gives each character any value between the two |
| **Seed** | For **Random**, picks the pattern. The same seed and text give the same result |
| **Skip Spaces** | Leaves spaces and line breaks as they are. On by default |
| **Preview** | Shows the change on the canvas while the dialog is open |

**From** and **To** take these values:

| Attribute | Range |
|---|---|
| **Font Size** | 0.1 to 1296 pt |
| **Baseline Shift** | -1296 to 1296 pt |
| **Character Rotation** | -360° to 360° |
| **Horizontal Scale** and **Vertical Scale** | 1% to 10000% |
| **Tracking** | -1000 to 10000 |
| **Leading** | 0.1 to 5000 pt |
| **Stroke Weight** | 0 to 1000 pt |

Stroke Weight shows only on characters that have a stroke.

## Release type from a path

Release Type on a Path, also part of the Type Tools plug-in, turns type on a path into point type on one straight line and the plain path it was set on. The point type keeps its text and its character and paragraph attributes. The path keeps its shape and has no fill and no stroke.

1. Select the type on a path with the Selection tool.
2. Choose **Object → Plug-ins → Type Tools → Release Type on a Path…**.
3. Set the options from the following table.
4. Click **OK**. The change is one undo step, and the released objects are selected.

| Option | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Mode** | What the command makes: **Text and Path** makes both, **Path Only** keeps only the path, and **Text Only** keeps only the point type | Text and Path |
| **Keep Original** | Leaves the type on a path in place and puts the released objects just above it | Off |
| **Preview** | Shows the result on the canvas while the dialog is open | Off |

![The Release Type on a Path dialog with Mode set to Text and Path, Keep Original off and Preview on, over a lantern festival poster. Above the dialog, the title LANTERN FESTIVAL ON THE RIVER sits on one straight line, and the arc it was set on shows as a separate path](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/release-type-on-path.webp)

## Other type commands

- **Type → Scale Text Attributes** changes a scaled type object so that its font size, leading, baseline shift and horizontal scale show the scaled values, and the object itself has no scale. It is available when the selected type has been scaled.
- **View → Snap to Glyph** lets drawing snap to the bounds of live type, and on a single line of type to its baseline, x-height, character widths and letter anchor points.

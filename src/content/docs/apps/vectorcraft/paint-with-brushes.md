This guide covers the Brushes panel and its five kinds of brushes, the Paintbrush and Blob Brush tools, brush libraries, and the Width tool, which makes a stroke wider or narrower at the points you choose.

| Tool or panel | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Brushes panel | F5 | F5 |
| Paintbrush tool | B | B |
| Blob Brush tool | Shift+B | Shift+B |
| Width tool | Shift+W | Shift+W |

## Kinds of brushes

A brush draws along the path of a stroke. The path keeps its anchor points, so you can still reshape it, and the brush follows the new shape. Open the Brushes panel with **Window → Brushes**. The panel groups the brushes by kind, in the order of the following table.

| Kind | What it draws along the path | How you make one |
|---|---|---|
| **Calligraphic** | An oval pen tip at a set angle, so the stroke is thicker in some directions than in others | **New Calligraphic Brush** in the panel menu, or **New Brush…** |
| **Scatter** | Copies of a piece of art spread along the path, with size, spacing, scatter and rotation that can vary | Select the art, then **New Scatter Brush from Selection** |
| **Art** | One piece of art stretched along the whole length of the path | Select the art, then **New Art Brush from Selection** |
| **Bristle** | Many thin, partly transparent strands, like the marks of a real paintbrush | **New Bristle Brush** in the panel menu, or **New Brush…** |
| **Pattern** | Tiles repeated along the path, with separate tiles for the sides, the corners and the two ends | Select the art for the side tile, then **New Pattern Brush from Selection** |

A new document has a starting set: 3 pt. Round, 6 pt. Flat and 10 pt. Oval (calligraphic), Dots, Confetti and Leaves (scatter), Charcoal, Tapered Stroke and Arrow (art), Bristle Round and Bristle Flat Fan (bristle), and Chain, Stitches and Diamonds (pattern).

The vine is selected with the Selection tool, and the Brushes panel below the Properties panel shows the brushes as thumbnails in rows by kind, with the vine brush highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brushes-panel.webp)

The panel menu, which opens from the button at the top right of the Brushes panel, also has these commands:

- **Show Calligraphic Brushes**, **Show Scatter Brushes**, **Show Art Brushes**, **Show Bristle Brushes** and **Show Pattern Brushes** hide or show that kind in the panel.
- **Thumbnail View** shows each brush as a tile, and **List View** shows a row with a preview and the brush's name.
- **Duplicate Brush** copies the selected brushes. A copy is named after the original with "copy" added.
- **Delete Brush** deletes the selected brushes, as the button at the bottom of the panel does.
- **Select All Unused** selects the brushes that no stroke in the document uses.

![The Brushes panel docked as a tab beside Properties, with its panel menu open over the dusk garden scene. The menu lists the New Brush commands, Duplicate Brush, Delete Brush, Remove Brush Stroke, Expand Brush Strokes, Brush Options, Select All Unused, the five Show commands with check marks, Thumbnail View (checked), List View, Open Brush Library and Save Brush Library](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brushes-panel-menu.webp)

To select several brushes in the panel, Shift-click to select a range, or Ctrl-click (Cmd-click on macOS) to add or remove one brush. To change the order of the brushes, drag a brush to a new place among the brushes of its kind.

![The Brushes panel in List View, docked as a tab beside Properties over the dusk garden scene. Each brush has a row with its preview and name, grouped by kind from 3 pt. Round to Coral Picket, and the Teal Vine row is highlighted because the selected vine uses that brush](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brushes-list-view.webp)

## Apply a brush to a path

1. Select one or more paths.
2. Click a brush in the Brushes panel. The brush is applied to the strokes of the selected paths. A path that has no stroke gets one in the current stroke color, or in black when the stroke is None.

![Three swirls in the dusk garden sky, selected together (3 Objects in Properties), after the Leaves scatter brush was clicked in the Brushes panel. Each swirl is now drawn as a trail of green leaves, and the Leaves brush is highlighted in the Brushes panel docked below Properties](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brush-apply-leaves.webp)

You can also drag a brush from the panel onto a path, whether or not it is selected.

The brush becomes the current brush, which the Paintbrush paints with. To make a brush current without applying it, click it with nothing selected.

To take the brush off a path and leave a plain stroke, select the path and click **Remove Brush Stroke** at the bottom of the panel, or choose it from the panel menu. To select every path that uses a brush, choose **Select → Object → Brush Strokes**, or **Select → Object → Bristle Brush Strokes** for the paths that use a bristle brush. For more ways to select, see [Select artwork](/apps/vectorcraft/select-artwork/).

A brush stroke takes its color from the stroke color. A scatter, art or pattern brush also uses its Colorization setting, which [Change a brush's options](#change-a-brushs-options) describes. To change the stroke color and weight, see [Fill, stroke and color](/apps/vectorcraft/fill-stroke-and-color/). To set the stroke's caps, corners, dashes, arrowheads and width profile in the Stroke panel, see [Style strokes with dashes, arrowheads and profiles](/apps/vectorcraft/style-strokes/).

## Paint with the Paintbrush

The Paintbrush draws a freehand path where you drag and applies the current brush to it.

1. In the Brushes panel, click the brush to paint with. Press **Ctrl+Shift+A** (**Cmd+Shift+A** on macOS) first if something is selected, so that the click does not apply the brush to the selection.
2. Press B to choose the Paintbrush tool.
3. Drag on the canvas. The stroke follows the pointer as you drag.
4. Release the mouse button. VectorCraft smooths the path and keeps it as a path with the brush on its stroke.

![The dusk garden scene at 90% zoom with the Paintbrush still the active tool and a new leafy teal vine just painted across the sky, kept selected with its path outline and three anchor points shown in yellow. The Brushes panel at the right has the vine brush highlighted, and the Properties panel shows the new path with a 1 pt teal stroke](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paintbrush-stroke.webp)

The stroke uses the current stroke color, or black when the stroke is None. With no current brush, the Paintbrush draws a plain stroke. With a drawing tablet, the Paintbrush records the pen pressure, tilt and barrel rotation, and brushes set to vary with them change along the stroke.

To close the path, press **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) after the stroke begins, and keep it held as you release. To smooth a selected path, hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) as you press, then drag along the path.

Double-click the Paintbrush tool in the Tools panel to open **Paintbrush Tool Options**. The options stay as you set them when you switch tools.

![Paintbrush Tool Options over the dusk garden scene, with the Fidelity slider at 1.5 px between Accurate and Smooth, Fill new strokes off, Keep selected on, Close paths when ends are within 15 px and Edit selected paths within 12 px](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paintbrush-tool-options.webp)

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Fidelity** | 1.5 px | How closely the path follows your drag. Drag the slider toward Accurate for a path that follows every movement, or toward Smooth for fewer anchor points and smoother curves. The field takes 0.01 to 100 px, measured on screen |
| **Fill new strokes** | Off | Fills each new path with the current fill color |
| **Keep selected** | On | Keeps the new path selected after you draw it. When it is off, nothing is selected after a stroke |
| **Close paths when ends are within** | 15 px | Closes the path when you end the stroke this close to where it began. 0 turns it off |
| **Edit selected paths within** | 12 px | When you start a stroke this close to a selected path, the stroke redraws that part of the path instead of starting a new one. 0 turns it off |

## Make your own brush from artwork

A scatter, art or pattern brush is made from artwork that you draw first.

1. Draw the art. For an art or pattern brush, draw it lying horizontally, so that it runs left to right.
2. Select the art. Several objects become one piece of brush art.
3. Click **New Brush** at the bottom of the Brushes panel, or choose **New Brush…** from the panel menu.
4. Choose **Scatter Brush**, **Art Brush** or **Pattern Brush** and click **OK**.
5. In the Brush Options dialog that opens, type a name and set the options, then click **OK**.

![A row of four amber and yellow lanterns drawn lying horizontally in the dusk garden sky and selected, with the New Brush dialog open beside it. Art Brush is chosen from Calligraphic Brush, Scatter Brush, Art Brush, Bristle Brush and Pattern Brush](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/new-brush-dialog.webp)

You can also drag the selected art from the canvas onto the list of brushes to open New Brush for it. The **New Art Brush from Selection**, **New Scatter Brush from Selection** and **New Pattern Brush from Selection** commands in the panel menu make the brush at once, without the dialog.

A calligraphic or bristle brush needs no art. Choose **Calligraphic Brush** or **Bristle Brush** in New Brush to set its options before you make it, or choose **New Calligraphic Brush** or **New Bristle Brush** in the panel menu to make one with the default options. A new brush is named New Art Brush, New Scatter Brush and so on, with a number when the name is taken.

:::tip
Draw scatter, art and pattern brush art in black and set **Colorization** to **Tints** in the brush's options. The brush then paints in whatever stroke color you choose.
:::

## Change a brush's options

Double-click a brush in the Brushes panel to open its options. You can also select a path and choose **Brush Options…** from the panel menu, which opens the options of that path's brush, or of the current brush when no brushed path is selected. When you click **OK**, every stroke that uses the brush updates. Each dialog has a preview of a stroke that updates as you change the values.

![The Art Brush Options dialog for the Teal Vine brush over the dusk garden scene, with Width 100% Fixed, Stretch to Fit Stroke Length and the left-to-right Direction selected. Flip Along, Flip Across and Overlap are off, Colorization Method is None with three key colors, and the preview shows the leafy vine along a sample stroke](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brush-options.webp)

**Calligraphic Brush Options** set the pen tip. **Angle** runs from −180° to 180°, **Roundness** from 0 to 100% and **Size** from 0 to 1296 pt. Each value can be **Fixed**, **Random**, **Pressure**, **Tilt**, **Bearing** or **Rotation**, with a **Variation** that sets how far it moves. Pressure, Tilt, Bearing and Rotation read a drawing tablet's pen.

![Calligraphic Brush Options for the Signature Nib brush over the dusk garden scene, with a preview of the narrow oval tip and a sample stroke. Angle is 40°, Roundness 25% and Size 9 pt, each Fixed with a Variation of 0](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/calligraphic-brush-options.webp)

**Bristle Brush Options** set the **Shape** of the brush (Round Point, Flat Point, Round Blunt, Flat Blunt, Round Curve, Flat Curve, Round Angle, Flat Angle, Round Fan or Flat Fan) and its **Size** from 0.1 to 1296 pt. **Bristle Length** runs from 25 to 300%, and **Bristle Density**, **Bristle Thickness**, **Paint Opacity** and **Stiffness** run from 1 to 100%.

![Bristle Brush Options for the Bristle Round brush over the dusk garden scene, with Shape set to Round Point, Size 6 px, Bristle Length 100%, Bristle Density 50%, Bristle Thickness 40%, Paint Opacity 75% and Stiffness 50%, above a preview stroke](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/bristle-brush-options.webp)

**Scatter Brush Options** set **Size** (1 to 10000%), **Spacing** (1 to 10000%), **Scatter** (−1000 to 1000%) and **Rotation** (−180° to 180°). Each has two values and a menu. With Fixed, the brush uses the first value; with Random, each copy gets a value between the two. **Rotation relative to** turns the copies with the **Page** or with the **Path**.

![Scatter Brush Options for the Evening Stars brush, with Size 50% to 130%, Spacing 120% to 220%, Scatter -80% to 80% and Rotation -180° to 180°, all set to Random, and Rotation relative to Page. Colorization Method is Tints, and the preview shows black stars scattered along a stroke](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/scatter-brush-options.webp)

**Art Brush Options** have these settings:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Width** | The width of the art, from 1 to 1000%. With **Pressure**, the second field sets the width at the heaviest pen pressure |
| **Scale Proportionately** | Keeps the art's proportions as it follows the path |
| **Stretch to Fit Stroke Length** | Stretches the art to the length of the path. This is the default |
| **Stretch Between Guides** | Stretches only the part of the art between **Start** and **End**, given in percent of the art's length, and keeps the ends as they are |
| **Direction** | Which way the art runs along the path: Left to Right, Right to Left, Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top |
| **Flip Along** and **Flip Across** | Mirror the art along the path or across it |
| **Overlap** | Bends the art on each run of the path between sharp corners |

**Pattern Brush Options** set **Scale** (1 to 10000%) and **Spacing** (0 to 10000%), the five tiles (**Outer Corner Tile**, **Side Tile**, **Inner Corner Tile**, **Start Tile** and **End Tile**), **Flip Along** and **Flip Across**, and the **Fit**: **Stretch to fit**, **Add space to fit** or **Approximate path**. A tile can be the brush's original art, None, a pattern swatch from the document, or, for a corner, a tile made from the side tile (**Auto-Centered**, **Auto-Between**, **Auto-Sliced** or **Auto-Overlap**). A pattern brush needs a side tile.

![Pattern Brush Options for the Coral Picket brush over the dusk garden scene, with Scale 100%, Spacing 0%, the picket as the Side Tile set to Original and None for the other four tiles. Flip Along and Flip Across are off, Fit is Stretch to fit, Colorization Method is Tints, and the preview shows the picket repeated along a curve](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/pattern-brush-options.webp)

Scatter, art and pattern brushes also have **Colorization**. Click **Tips** beside **Method** to see a sample of each method.

| Method | What happens to the art's colors |
|---|---|
| **None** | The art keeps its own colors |
| **Tints** | Black becomes the stroke color and white stays white. Other colors become tints of the stroke color by their lightness |
| **Tints and Shades** | Black and white stay as they are. Dark colors become shades of the stroke color, and light colors become tints of it |
| **Hue Shift** | The **Key Color** becomes the stroke color. The other colors shift their hue by the same amount and keep their saturation and brightness. Pick the key color from the art's colors, or with the eyedropper |

![Scatter Brush Options for the Evening Stars brush with Colorization Tips open below the Tips button. The tips show a sample of the stars on a blue stroke for each of None, Tints, Tints and Shades and Hue Shift, with a sentence on what each method does](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/colorization-tips.webp)

To delete brushes, select them in the panel and click **Delete Brush**. When no stroke uses them, VectorCraft asks whether to delete them. When strokes use them, click **Remove Strokes** to take the brushes off those strokes, which keep a plain stroke, and delete the brushes. Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) **Delete Brush** to delete brushes that no stroke uses without being asked.

![The Delete Brush question over the dusk garden scene, after Delete Brush was chosen with the vine selected and the Teal Vine brush highlighted in the Brushes panel. The question says that strokes use the brushes and asks whether to take the brushes off those strokes and delete them, with Remove Strokes and Cancel buttons](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/delete-brush-dialog.webp)

## Load and save brush libraries

A brush library is a set of brushes that opens in its own panel. Libraries are read-only: to use a brush, you add it to the document's Brushes panel.

![The Brush Libraries Menu open above its button at the bottom left of the Brushes panel, over the dusk garden scene. It lists Art Ribbons, Calligraphic Nibs, Pattern Borders, Scatter Shapes, Game Trails and Energy Beams, with the pointer on Energy Beams, then Other Library… and Save Brushes…](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brush-libraries-menu.webp)

1. Choose **Window → Brush Libraries**, click **Brush Libraries Menu** at the bottom left of the Brushes panel, or choose **Open Brush Library** from the panel menu, and choose a library. VectorCraft has six: Art Ribbons, Calligraphic Nibs, Pattern Borders, Scatter Shapes, Game Trails and Energy Beams.
2. Click a brush in the library panel. The brush is added to the Brushes panel as the current brush, and it is applied to any selected paths.

![The Art Ribbons library panel docked below the Brushes panel, after its Striped Ribbon brush was clicked with three swirls selected in the dusk garden sky. The swirls now draw as blue striped ribbons, and the added brush is highlighted in the Brushes panel](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brush-library-panel.webp)

You can also drag a library brush onto a path to apply it, or onto the Brushes panel to add it. A brush that the document already has is not added twice, and a brush whose name is taken gets a number.

To see each brush's name next to its preview, choose **Large List View** or **Small List View** from the menu at the top right of the library panel.

To use the brushes of another file, choose **Window → Brush Libraries → Other Library…** and open any document that VectorCraft can open. The library stays in the menu until you quit VectorCraft.

To save the document's brushes as a library:

1. In the Brushes panel, select the brushes to save, or select none to save them all.
2. Choose **Save Brush Library…** from the panel menu, or **Window → Brush Libraries → Save Brushes…**.
3. Type a **Name**, and under **Save To**, choose **User Defined Libraries** or **A File…**. Turn on **Selected Brushes Only** to save only the brushes you selected.
4. Click **OK**.

![The Save Brush Library dialog over the dusk garden scene, with the name Dusk Garden Brushes, Save To set to User Defined Libraries and Selected Brushes Only (4) turned on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/save-brush-library.webp)

A library is saved as a `.vectorcraft` file that holds the brushes and everything their art uses, such as patterns, symbols and swatches. Libraries saved to User Defined Libraries are listed under **Window → Brush Libraries → User Defined**.

### Paint beams with the Energy Beams library

Game Trails and Energy Beams hold art brushes for motion lines, streaks and beams. Game Trails has Speed Line, Dash Trail, Burst Ray and Zigzag. Energy Beams has four brushes:

| Brush | What it draws along the path |
|---|---|
| **Laser Bolt** | A straight beam that is widest in the middle and narrows toward both ends |
| **Plasma Arc** | A band that bends in one arch |
| **Charge Wave** | A band that swings through one full wave |
| **Spark Trail** | A row of short dashes |

Every brush in both libraries uses the **Tints** colorization method, so it draws in the stroke color. To paint beams in several colors, change the stroke color before each stroke.

1. Choose **Window → Brush Libraries → Energy Beams**.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+A** (**Cmd+Shift+A** on macOS) to deselect, then click a brush in the Energy Beams panel. It is added to the Brushes panel and becomes the current brush.
3. Set the stroke color and weight, press B to choose the Paintbrush, and drag on the canvas.

![A night harbor with a striped lighthouse on a dark point and three beams spreading from its lantern across the starry sky: a cyan Laser Bolt that is widest in the middle, a magenta Plasma Arc that sags in one arch, and a newly painted amber Charge Wave that dips and rises through one full wave and is still selected, with its path shown as a thin blue line. The Paintbrush is the active tool, Properties shows the path with an 8 pt amber stroke, and the Energy Beams panel below the Brushes panel lists Laser Bolt, Plasma Arc, Charge Wave and Spark Trail with Charge Wave highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/brushes-energy-beams.webp)

## Vary a stroke's width with the Width tool

The Width tool makes a stroke wider or narrower at points along its path. It works on any stroke, with or without a brush.

1. Press Shift+W to choose the Width tool. It shares a slot in the Tools panel with the Warp tool and the other distortion tools.
2. Move the pointer over a stroke. A hollow diamond and the stroke's width at that place appear.
3. Drag outward from the path. VectorCraft adds a width point there and widens both sides of the stroke equally. A readout shows the total width as you drag.
4. Release the mouse button.

![A blue river stroked across teal and navy hills under a coral sky at 130% zoom, with the Width tool dragging a width point out to W: 24.07 pt between two narrower width points. The status bar shows the Width tool's hints for adding, changing, selecting, editing and deleting width points](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/width-tool.webp)

Between two width points, the width changes along a smooth curve and stays between the widths of those two points. The stroke has no corner at a width point. At a width point that is wider or narrower than both of its neighbors, the width stops growing or shrinking. Where the widths of several width points change by the same amount per unit of length, the width keeps changing at that even rate between them.

To change one side only, hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) as you drag. To move a width point along the path, drag its center. To copy it, Alt-drag (Option-drag on macOS) its center. When you drop a width point onto another one, the width changes in a single step at that place.

Shift-click width points to select several. Dragging one of them then moves or widens them all. Press Delete or Backspace to remove the selected width points, or Esc to deselect them.

To type exact widths, double-click a stroke or a width point to open **Width Point Edit**:

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Side 1** and **Side 2** | The width on each side of the path |
| **Keep both sides the same width** | The link button between the sides. When it is on, changing one side changes the other |
| **Total Width** | The width of both sides together. Changing it changes both sides in proportion |
| **Adjust Adjoining Width Points** | Also changes the nearest width points on either side in proportion |

Click **Delete** in the dialog to remove the width point. Shift-double-click a width point to open the dialog with Adjust Adjoining Width Points turned on.

![The Width tool on a blue river stroke across the dusk hills at 130% zoom, with Width Point Edit open for the widest width point. Side 1 and Side 2 are 12 pt with the link button on, Total Width is 24 pt and Adjust Adjoining Width Points is off, and the status bar shows the Width tool's hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/width-point-edit.webp)

## Paint filled shapes with the Blob Brush

The Blob Brush paints filled shapes instead of stroked paths. A shape that you paint over another shape with the same fill and no stroke merges with it, so you can build up one shape stroke by stroke.

1. Set the stroke color to the color you want to paint with. The Blob Brush uses the stroke color, or the fill color when the stroke is None.
2. Press Shift+B to choose the Blob Brush tool.
3. Drag on the canvas. Press [ to make the tip 1 pt smaller or ] to make it 1 pt larger.

![The Blob Brush part way through a stroke in a cloud study over the dusk sky. A thin blue outline shows the area being painted as it arcs up and to the left out of the top of a lavender cloud, with the round tip outline under the pointer and an L: 205.75 px readout of the stroke's length](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/blob-brush-painting.webp)

A new shape merges with the topmost touching path that has the same fill and no stroke, and with the touching paths next to it in the stacking order of the same group or layer. Hold Shift as you drag to keep the stroke on a horizontal or vertical line. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) as you press to smooth the selected paths instead.

Double-click the Blob Brush tool in the Tools panel to open **Blob Brush Tool Options**:

| Option | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Fidelity** | 1.5 pt | How closely the shape follows your drag, from Accurate to Smooth |
| **Angle** | 0° | The angle of the tip's long side, from −180° to 180° |
| **Roundness** | 100% | The tip's short side as a percentage of its long side. 100% is round. The preview beside it shows the tip |
| **Size** | 10 pt, Fixed | The tip's width, from 0.1 to 1000 pt. With **Pressure**, the tip is Size minus **Variation** wide at the lightest pen pressure and Size plus Variation at the heaviest |
| **Variation** | 0 pt | How far the size changes with pressure, from 0 to 1000 pt. It is available only with Pressure |
| **Keep selected** | Off | Keeps the new or merged shape selected |
| **Merge only with selection** | Off | Merges a new shape only with selected paths |

![Blob Brush Tool Options over the cloud study, with Fidelity 1.5 pt, Angle 0°, Roundness 100% and a preview of the round tip, Size 10 pt Fixed, Variation 0 pt dimmed, and Keep selected and Merge only with selection off](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/blob-brush-options.webp)

## Turn brush strokes into paths

Expanding a brush stroke replaces it with the artwork that the brush draws, as ordinary objects that you can edit one by one.

1. Select the paths that have brush strokes.
2. Click **Expand Brush Strokes** at the bottom of the Brushes panel, or choose it from the panel menu.

![The dusk garden after Expand Brush Strokes on the vine. The vine looks as it did before and is now a selected group with its bounding box, and the Layers panel shows the group open in Layer 1 with a nested group that holds a path for each berry, a path for the stem and a path for each leaf](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/expand-brush-strokes.webp)

Expand Brush Strokes replaces each path with a group of the brush art. To undo it, press **Ctrl+Z** (**Cmd+Z** on macOS).

:::caution
An expanded brush stroke no longer follows a path. To change its shape or brush afterward, undo the expand or start again from a copy of the original path.

This guide shows how to add the three kinds of type in VectorCraft, flow one story through several frames, and set the font, size, spacing and alignment of the text. It ends with turning letters into paths for artwork that no longer needs to be edited as text. The following image shows one example of each kind of type in one document.

![A sunset poster with the three kinds of type: the headline Golden Hour set as point type, a paragraph wrapping inside a rectangular frame, and the line OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT running along an arc over the sun. The line on the arc is selected](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/type-kinds.webp)

## Kinds of type

| Kind | How to make it | What shapes it |
|---|---|---|
| Point type | Click with the Type tool and type. | Point type does not wrap. Each line ends where you press Enter. |
| Area type | Drag a frame with the Type tool, or click the outline of a closed path. | The text wraps at the frame's edges. **Type → Area Type Options…** sets rows, columns, gutters and inset. |
| Type on a path | Click the outline of an open path with the Type tool, or click any path with the Type on a Path tool. | The text follows the path. Drag the start, center and end brackets, or set options in **Type → Type on a Path → Type on a Path Options…**. |

## Choose a type tool

The seven type tools share one group in the toolbar. The Type tool shows by default. Press and hold it to choose another tool from the group.

| Tool | Shortcut | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Type Tool** | T | A click on empty canvas makes point type, and a drag makes area type. A click on the outline of a closed path sets type inside the path, and a click on an open path sets type along it. |
| **Area Type Tool** | None | A click on the outline of a closed path sets type inside the path. On empty canvas, the tool works as the Type tool does. |
| **Type on a Path Tool** | None | A click on the outline of an open or closed path sets type along the path. On empty canvas, the tool works as the Type tool does. |
| **Vertical Type Tool** | None | Works as the Type tool does, with each line running from top to bottom. |
| **Vertical Area Type Tool** | None | Works as the Area Type tool does, with vertical lines. |
| **Vertical Type on a Path Tool** | None | Works as the Type on a Path tool does, with vertical type. |
| **Touch Type Tool** | Shift+T | Moves, scales and rotates single characters of existing type, which stays editable. |

Before you start typing, hold Shift while you click to use the vertical version of a horizontal tool, or the horizontal version of a vertical one. With the Area Type or Type on a Path tool, hold Alt (Option on macOS) while you click to use the other of those two tools. [Set vertical type](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#set-vertical-type) covers the vertical tools.

To change one character with the Touch Type tool:

1. Choose the Touch Type tool (**Shift+T**) and click a character of a type object. A box with handles appears around that character.
2. Drag the box, or its lower-left handle, to move the character along its line or up and down. Drag the upper-left handle to scale it vertically, the lower-right handle to scale it horizontally, or the upper-right handle to scale it proportionally. Drag the handle in the middle of the top edge to rotate it.

Each drag is one undo step. Press Escape to let go of the character.

## Add point type

1. Choose the Type tool (T).
2. Click an empty part of the artboard and type.
3. Press Enter to start a new line.
4. Click an empty part of the canvas to stop editing. The next click makes new type.

If you click to place point type and leave it empty, VectorCraft removes it when you stop editing.

## Add area type

1. Choose the Type tool (T).
2. Drag on the artboard to draw a frame, then type. The text wraps when it reaches the frame's edge.
3. To set type inside a shape you already drew, click the outline of the closed path with the Type tool instead. The path becomes the frame, and its fill and stroke are removed.
4. With the type selected, choose **Type → Area Type Options…** to set the number of rows and columns, the gutter between them, the inset from the frame's edge, the first baseline, the vertical alignment of the lines, and how the frame fits its text (**None**, **Auto Size** or **Shrink Text to Fit**).

To set up columns in a frame:

1. Select the area type with the Selection tool.
2. Choose **Type → Area Type Options…**.
3. Set the options from the following table, for example **Columns** 2 and **Gutter** 12 pt.
4. Click **OK**.

![A night market menu card with a coral and amber awning, string lights and the headline Night Market. The selected frame of dish names and dot-leader prices flows in two columns, and the Area Type Options dialog beside it shows Columns 2, First Baseline Ascent, Fit None, Fit Min Percent 50, Gutter 12 pt, Height 300 pt, Inset 6 pt, Row Gutter 12 pt, Rows 1, Vertical Align Top, Width 492 pt and Text Flow By Columns](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/area-type-options.webp)

| Option | What it sets | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Columns** and **Rows** | How many columns and rows the frame is divided into, from 1 to 100 | 1 |
| **First Baseline** | Where the first line sits below the top of the frame: **Ascent**, **Cap Height**, **x Height**, **Leading** or **Fixed** | Ascent |
| **First Baseline Min** | The smallest distance from the top of the frame to the first baseline | 0 pt |
| **Fit** | How the frame and its text fit each other. **None** keeps the frame's size, and text that does not fit overflows. **Auto Size** makes the frame's height follow the text after every edit; typing a **Height** turns it off. **Shrink Text to Fit** scales text that does not fit down until it fits. | None |
| **Fit Min Percent** | The smallest size, in percent of the original, that **Shrink Text to Fit** scales the text to, from 10 to 100. Size, leading and baseline shift scale together. | 50 |
| **Gutter** | The space between columns, and between rows unless **Row Gutter** differs, from 0 to 10,000 pt | 18 pt |
| **Height** and **Width** | The size of the frame, measured from its top-left corner. The text reflows at the new size. | The frame's size |
| **Inset** | The space between the frame's edge and the text, from 0 to 10,000 pt | 0 pt |
| **Row Gutter** | The space between rows when it differs from the gutter between columns. While it matches **Gutter**, it changes with **Gutter**. | The Gutter value |
| **Vertical Align** | Where the lines sit in each row or column: **Top**, **Center**, **Bottom** or **Justify** | Top |
| **Text Flow** | **By Columns** fills each column from top to bottom before it moves across. **By Rows** fills each row across before it moves down. | By Columns |

To switch a selected type object between the two kinds, choose **Type → Convert To Area Type** or **Type → Convert To Point Type**. Converting area type to point type turns each soft line wrap into a line break.

Converting point type to area type puts a frame around the text as it is laid out.

:::tip
A selected type object shows a small circle beside the right side of its bounding box: hollow on point type and filled on area type. Double-click the circle with the Selection tool to convert the type to the other kind. The text and its styles stay the same.
:::

## Put type on a path

1. Draw a path with the Pen, Curvature or Pencil tool, or use a shape.
2. Choose the Type tool and click the outline of an open path. For a closed path, choose the Type on a Path tool from the Type tool's group and click the outline.
3. Type the text. It runs along the path, and the path's fill and stroke are removed.
4. Switch to the Selection or Direct Selection tool. The selected type shows a start bracket, a center bracket and an end bracket.
5. Drag the start or end bracket to set where the type begins or ends along the path.
6. Drag the center bracket along the path to slide the type. Drag it across the path to flip the type to the other side. Hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) while you drag to slide the type without flipping it.

The **Type → Type on a Path** submenu applies an effect that changes how each letter sits on the path: **Rainbow**, **Skew**, **3D Ribbon**, **Stair Step** or **Gravity**. **Type → Type on a Path → Type on a Path Options…** sets the effect, the flip, **Align to Path** (**Ascender**, **Descender**, **Center** or **Baseline**) and the spacing.

| Effect | How each letter sits on the path |
|---|---|
| **Rainbow** | Each letter turns with the path. This is the default. |
| **Skew** | The vertical edges of the letters stay vertical, and the baseline follows the path. |
| **3D Ribbon** | The horizontal edges of the letters stay horizontal, and the vertical edges stand at right angles to the path. |
| **Stair Step** | The letters do not turn. The left end of each letter's baseline sits on the path. |
| **Gravity** | The center of each letter's baseline sits on the path, and each letter points away from the path's center. |

The submenu shows a check mark beside the effect of the selected type. To set every option in one dialog:

1. Select the type on a path with the Selection tool.
2. Choose **Type → Type on a Path → Type on a Path Options…**, or click **Type on a Path Options** in the Contextual Task Bar.
3. Set the options from the following table. With **Preview** on, the type on the canvas changes as you edit them.
4. Click **OK**. **Cancel** undoes the preview.

![A carousel sign at night with the words Open Until Midnight running along an arch of lit bulbs above plum and coral canopy stripes. The type on the path is selected, and the Type on a Path Options dialog beside it shows Align to Path set to Baseline, Effect set to Rainbow, Flip off, Spacing 0 pt and Preview on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/type-on-path-options.webp)

| Option | What it sets | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Align to Path** | Which height of the type runs along the path. With **Ascender**, the type hangs below the path. With **Descender**, it stands above the path. **Center** runs the path halfway between the ascender and the descender, and **Baseline** puts the baseline on the path. | Baseline |
| **Effect** | **Rainbow**, **Skew**, **3D Ribbon**, **Stair Step** or **Gravity**, as described in the effects table | Rainbow |
| **Flip** | Moves the type to the other side of its path. The checkbox is off each time the dialog opens, so turning it on again flips the type back. | Off |
| **Spacing** | Spaces the letters as if they were set this far above the path. On a curve, the letters close up on the outside of the curve and open up on the inside. | 0 pt |
| **Preview** | Shows the changes on the canvas before you click **OK** | Off |

To turn type on a path back into point type and a plain path, see [Release type from a path](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#release-type-from-a-path).

## Flow text between frames

Threaded text is one story that flows through several frames in order. Area type and type on a path can be threaded in any mix.

1. Select two or more area-type frames, type on a path objects or closed paths.
2. Choose **Type → Threaded Text → Create**.

VectorCraft threads the objects in stacking order. Closed paths in the selection become area-type frames. Text that does not fit in one frame continues in the next. The following image shows one story flowing through two frames, with the thread line joining them.

![A night market flyer with striped awnings, string lights and two side-by-side text frames. One story flows from the first frame into the second, and a thread line joins the first frame's out port to the second frame's in port](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/threaded-text.webp)

You can also thread from a single frame with the Selection tool:

1. Select the area type or type on a path. It shows an in port and an out port.
2. Click the out port. The pointer is loaded with the text.
3. Click a closed path or another type object to flow the text into it, click empty canvas to make a new frame of the same kind, shape and size, or drag to draw a rectangle for the new frame.

A click on the in port works the same way, except that the new frame comes before the clicked one in the thread. Press Escape to drop the loaded text.

To undo threading:

- **Type → Threaded Text → Release Selection** takes the selected frames out of their thread. The story flows on through the remaining frames.
- **Type → Threaded Text → Remove Threading** breaks the threads of the selected frames. Each frame keeps the text it shows.

**View → Hide Text Threads** (**Ctrl+Shift+Y**, or **Cmd+Shift+Y** on macOS) hides the lines drawn between threaded frames. Choose it again to show them.

## Set the font, size and spacing

The Character panel (**Window → Type → Character**; **Ctrl+T**, or **Cmd+T** on macOS) styles the selected type objects, or the characters you selected with the Type tool. Select a type object first; with nothing selected, the panel shows "Select a text object to edit its character attributes." The following screenshot shows the panel with the point type headline selected.

![The Character panel beside the selected headline Golden Hour on a sunset poster, set to Source Serif 4 Regular at 54 pt with 64.8 pt leading, followed by the kerning, tracking, scale, baseline shift and rotation fields, the row of style buttons and the Language menu](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/character-panel.webp)

The panel holds these controls. Hover over the symbol beside a field to see the field's name.

| Control | What it sets |
|---|---|
| Font family and style | The typeface and its weight or style |
| **Font Size** | The size of the characters |
| **Leading** | The distance between lines |
| **Kerning** | The space between a pair of characters; **Optical** is one of its choices |
| **Tracking** | The space across a range of characters |
| **Vertical Scale %** and **Horizontal Scale %** | The vertical or horizontal stretch of the characters |
| **Baseline Shift** | How far the characters move up or down from the baseline |
| **Character Rotation** | The rotation of each character |
| **All Caps**, **Small Caps**, **Superscript**, **Subscript**, **Underline**, **Strikethrough** | Buttons that turn each style on or off |
| **Language** | The language the characters are shaped in, so the font uses that language's letter forms |

**Hide Options** in the panel menu hides every row below the size, leading, kerning and tracking fields, and **Show Options** shows them again. The panel menu also holds **Reset Panel**.

When the text uses a variable font, the panel shows a **Variable Font** button. It opens a slider for each axis of the font, such as its weight or width.

To make the selected type bold or italic, choose **Type → Bold** or **Type → Italic**. **Bold** switches the text to the Bold face of its font family, or back to the regular face when the text is already bold, and keeps italics. **Italic** switches to the Italic or Oblique face, or back to upright, and keeps the weight. When the family has no such face, the text stays as it is and VectorCraft shows a message. While you edit text with the Type tool, **Ctrl+Shift+B** and **Ctrl+Shift+I** (**Cmd+Shift+B** and **Cmd+Shift+I** on macOS) run the two commands.

The panel menu, which opens from the button at the top right of the panel, holds these items:

| Menu item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Hide Options** or **Show Options** | Hides or shows the rows below the size, leading, kerning and tracking fields |
| **Show Snap to Glyph Options** or **Hide Snap to Glyph Options** | Shows or hides the **Snap to Glyph** checkbox and the guides it gives: **Baseline**, **x-height**, **Glyph Bounds**, **Proximity Guides**, **Angular Guides** and **Anchor Point** |
| **Show Font Height Options** or **Hide Font Height Options** | Shows or hides **Set Font Height Reference** under **Font Size**. It sets which height of the font the size measures: **Em Box**, **Cap Height**, **x-Height** or **ICF Box**. |
| **All Caps**, **Underline**, **Strikethrough**, **Small Caps**, **Superscript**, **Subscript** | The same styles as the panel's buttons. An item is checked when every character the panel acts on has that style. |
| **No Break** | Keeps the selected characters together on one line |
| **Fractional Widths** | Spaces the characters of the whole type object by fractions of a point. It is on by default. |
| **System Layout** | Spaces the characters of every text object in the document by whole points |
| **Refresh Font List** | Adds fonts that were installed after VectorCraft started |
| **Reset Panel** | Returns the characters to tracking 0, Auto leading and kerning, no baseline shift, 100% scales, no rotation, the styles off, **No Break** off and the Em Box font height reference |
| **Float Panel** or **Dock Panel** | Moves the panel out of the dock into a floating window of its own, or back into the dock |

More items appear when you turn on a language option on the Type page of [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#type):

- **Show East Asian Options** adds **Character Alignment**, **Proportional Metrics**, **Tate-chu-yoko**, **Tate-chu-yoko Settings…** and **Standard Vertical Roman Alignment**. [Set vertical type](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#set-vertical-type) describes the tate-chu-yoko commands and Standard Vertical Roman Alignment.
- **Show Indic Options** adds **Digits**, **Character Direction** (**Default**, **Left to Right** or **Right to Left**) and **Kashidas**.

While you edit horizontal text with the Type tool, the Alt key (Option on macOS) with the arrow keys changes spacing by the increments set in **Preferences → Type**:

- **Alt+Left** and **Alt+Right** (**Option+Left** and **Option+Right** on macOS) change the kerning at the caret or the tracking of the selected text.
- **Alt+Up** and **Alt+Down** (**Option+Up** and **Option+Down** on macOS) change the leading.
- **Alt+Shift+Up** and **Alt+Shift+Down** (**Option+Shift+Up** and **Option+Shift+Down** on macOS) change the baseline shift.

## Set paragraph options

The Paragraph panel (**Window → Type → Paragraph**; **Ctrl+Alt+T**, or **Cmd+Option+T** on macOS) sets alignment, indents and the space around paragraphs. Its alignment buttons are **Align left**, **Align center**, **Align right**, **Justify with last line aligned left**, **Justify with last line aligned center**, **Justify with last line aligned right** and **Justify all lines**. Below them are **Left Indent**, **Right Indent**, **First-line Left Indent**, **Space Before Paragraph** and **Space After Paragraph**, and the **Hyphenate** option. With nothing selected, the panel shows "Select a text object to edit its paragraph attributes."

The alignment applies to the paragraphs of the selected type, or to the paragraphs that the Type tool's selection touches.

**Window → Type** also opens the **Character Styles**, **Paragraph Styles**, **Glyphs**, **OpenType** and **Tabs** panels.

To set the options of one paragraph:

1. Choose the Type tool (T) and click in the paragraph. To change every paragraph of a type object, select the object with the Selection tool instead.
2. Open the Paragraph panel.
3. Click an alignment button, and type values in the indent and spacing fields.
4. Turn on **Hyphenate** to break long words with a hyphen at the ends of lines.

![A night market flyer with a coral and amber awning, string lights and the headline Night Market above a frame of body text in two columns. The Type tool's caret is in the second paragraph, and the Paragraph panel docked at the right shows Justify with last line aligned left selected, Left Indent 0 pt, Right Indent 0 pt, First-line Left Indent 12 pt, Space Before 0 pt, Space After 6 pt and Hyphenate on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/paragraph-panel.webp)

| Control | What it sets |
|---|---|
| Alignment buttons | How the lines of each paragraph line up |
| **Bullets** | Starts each paragraph with a bullet. The arrow beside the button lists **None**, **Filled Dot**, **Dash**, **Hollow Circle** and **Filled Square**. [Make lists and fit type to its frame](/apps/vectorcraft/make-lists-and-fit-type/#start-a-bulleted-or-numbered-list) describes how to make and edit lists. |
| **Numbered List** | Starts each paragraph with a number. The arrow beside the button lists **None**, **1, 2, 3**, **A, B, C**, **a, b, c**, **I, II, III**, **i, ii, iii**, **01, 02, 03** and **001, 002, 003**. **More Options** at the end of either list opens the Bullets and Numbering dialog, as described in [Set list options](/apps/vectorcraft/make-lists-and-fit-type/#set-list-options). |
| **Left Indent** and **Right Indent** | The space between the frame's sides and the paragraph, from -1296 to 1296 pt |
| **First-line Left Indent** | The extra indent of the paragraph's first line, from -1296 to 1296 pt. A negative value makes a hanging indent. |
| **Space Before Paragraph** and **Space After Paragraph** | The space above and below the paragraph, from 0 to 1296 pt |
| **Hyphenate** | Breaks words with a hyphen at the ends of lines, within the limits set in the Hyphenation dialog |

With **Show Indic Options** on in Preferences, the panel also shows the **Left-to-Right Paragraph Direction** and **Right-to-Left Paragraph Direction** buttons after the alignment buttons, and an **Insert Kashidas** menu. With **Show East Asian Options** on, it shows the **Mojikumi Set** and **Kinsoku Set** menus. [Show the East Asian options](/apps/vectorcraft/set-type-for-other-languages/#show-the-east-asian-options) shows where to turn on both options.

The Paragraph panel menu holds these items:

| Menu item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Hide Options** or **Show Options** | Hides or shows the **Hyphenate** option and the rows below it |
| **Roman Hanging Punctuation** | Hangs quotation marks, hyphens, periods and commas at the ends of a line outside the margin |
| **Justification…** | Opens the Justification dialog, which sets word spacing, letter spacing and glyph scaling for justified lines |
| **Hyphenation…** | Opens the Hyphenation dialog, which sets which words break and where |
| **Single-line Composer** | Breaks each line of the paragraph on its own |
| **Every-line Composer** | Sets the line breaks of the whole paragraph together. This is the default. |
| **Reset Panel** | Returns the paragraphs to automatic alignment, no bullets or numbering, no indents or spacing, **Hyphenate** off, the default hyphenation and justification settings, **Roman Hanging Punctuation** off and the **Every-line Composer** |

With **Show East Asian Options** on, the menu also holds **Top-to-Top Leading**, **Bottom-to-Bottom Leading**, **Burasagari** (**None**, **Regular** or **Force**) and **Kinsoku Shori Type** (**Push In First**, **Push Out First** or **Push Out Only**). [Fine-tune justification and hyphenation](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#fine-tune-justification-and-hyphenation) describes the two dialogs and the composers.

| **Show Hidden Characters** | Show markers for spaces, paragraph ends and story ends |
| **Type Orientation** | Set the selected type to **Horizontal** or **Vertical** lines, as described in [Set vertical type](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#set-vertical-type) |

## Turn type into shapes

**Type → Create Outlines** (**Ctrl+Shift+O**, or **Cmd+Shift+O** on macOS) converts the selected type into groups of compound paths, one path for each letter. You can then edit the letters with the path tools.

:::caution
After Create Outlines, the letters are paths and you can no longer edit the wording or change the font. Duplicate the type before you convert it, and keep the copy on a hidden layer if you might need to change the text later.
:::

A frame of threaded text that you convert leaves its thread and keeps only the text it shows.

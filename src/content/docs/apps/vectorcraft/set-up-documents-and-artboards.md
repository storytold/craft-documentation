This page shows how to start a new document from a preset or your own size, then add, name and arrange its artboards. It also covers the document's units, bleed and color mode, the tools and shortcuts you use to move around the canvas, and rulers, guides and grids.

## Create a document

1. Choose **File → New…** (**Ctrl+N**, or **Cmd+N** on macOS). The **New Document** dialog opens.
2. Pick a category along the top: **Recent**, **Saved**, **Mobile**, **Web**, **Print**, **Film & Video**, **Art & Illustration**, **Branding** or **Social**.
3. Click a preset card. A double-click on a card creates the document right away.
4. Under **PRESET DETAILS**, change the name, **Width**, **Height**, units, **Orientation** and number of **Artboards** as needed.
5. Click **Create**.

Preset Details on the right shows the name Dusk Postcard, 432 pt by 288 pt, landscape orientation, 6 artboards and a 9 pt bleed on every side](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/new-document-dialog.webp)

**Recent** lists the sizes you used last. To keep a size of your own as a preset:

1. Set the size and the other fields under **PRESET DETAILS**.
2. Click **Save Preset** beside the **Document Name** field. The top of the column changes to **Save Document Preset**, with a **Preset Name** field, **Cancel** and **Save**. **Close** and **Create** are hidden until you save or cancel.
3. Type a **Preset Name** over the suggested one (Preset 1, Preset 2 and so on). The fields under the name stay editable, and the preset stores their values.
4. Click **Save**, or press Enter in the name field. The preset then appears under **Saved**, and the dialog switches to that category with the new preset chosen. Click **Cancel** or press Escape to leave without saving.

The Preset Details column is saving a preset: the Save Document Preset heading, Dusk Postcard in the name field and the Cancel and Save buttons, with 432 pt by 288 pt, landscape orientation and 1 artboard below them](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/new-document-save-preset.webp)

**Advanced Options** holds **Color Mode**, **Raster Effects** and **Preview Mode**. **More Settings** opens a pop-up over the dialog with **Number of Artboards** and the layout of several artboards: the four layout buttons, **Change to Right-to-Left Layout**, **Spacing** and **Columns**. The layout controls are unavailable while the number of artboards is 1, and **Columns** is unavailable with Arrange by Row and Arrange by Column. Click **Done** or press Enter to close the pop-up. A click outside it or Escape also closes it, and the fields keep the values you set in it.

| Setting | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Width** and **Height** | Any size, in the units shown beside **Width** | 612 × 792 pt (Letter) while **Recent** is empty, and the last size you used after that |
| **Units** | Pixels, Points, Picas, Inches, Millimeters, Centimeters, Feet, Yards, Meters, Feet & Inches | Pixels for screen presets, and the general unit set in Preferences for the others |
| **Orientation** | Portrait, Landscape | Set by the preset's width and height |
| **Artboards** | 1 to 1000 | 1 |
| Artboard layout (**More Settings**) | Grid by Row, Grid by Column, Arrange by Row, Arrange by Column, with **Spacing**, **Columns** and **Change to Right-to-Left Layout** | Grid by Row, 20 pt spacing |
| **Bleed** | 0 to 72 pt on each side | 0 |
| **Background Contents** | Transparent, White | Transparent |
| **Color Mode** | RGB Color, CMYK Color | CMYK for Print and Branding presets, RGB for the others |
| **Raster Effects** | Screen (72 ppi), Medium (150 ppi), High (300 ppi) | 300 ppi for Print, Art & Illustration and Branding presets, 72 ppi for the others |
| **Preview Mode** | Default, Pixel, Overprint | Default |

:::tip
**New Without Dialog** (**Ctrl+Alt+N**, or **Cmd+Option+N** on macOS) makes a document with the settings the New Document dialog would open on, without showing the dialog.
:::

To start from a template, choose **File → New from Template…** (**Ctrl+Shift+N**, or **Cmd+Shift+N** on macOS) and pick the file. It opens as a new untitled document.

## Add and arrange artboards

An artboard is a page inside the document. A document can hold many artboards of different sizes.

1. Choose the **Artboard** tool (Shift+O).
2. Drag on the empty area around the artboards to draw a new artboard. Hold Shift and drag to draw a new artboard inside an existing one.
3. Drag inside an artboard to move it, or drag one of its handles to resize it. Hold Shift for a proportional resize, or **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to resize from the center.
4. Click an object to add an artboard that fits the object's visible bounds.
5. Press Escape to go back to the **Selection** tool.

While the Artboard tool is active, the Control bar shows **Move Artwork with Artboard** (on by default) and **Scale Artwork with Artboard** (off by default). Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) while you drag an artboard to move a copy of it.

To copy, paste, rename, lock or delete artboards from the Artboard tool's right-click menu, see [Manage artboards](/apps/vectorcraft/manage-artboards/).

![Six postcard artboards in a three-by-two grid, each holding a small sunset or night scene. The Artboard tool is resizing the Lanterns artboard, the Control bar shows Move Artwork with Artboard turned on, and the Artboards panel lists the six artboards by name with Lanterns highlighted](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/artboards-grid.webp)

### Use the Artboards panel

Choose **Window → Artboards** to list every artboard in order. The buttons at the bottom of the panel are **Rearrange All Artboards**, **Move Up**, **Move Down**, **New Artboard** and **Delete Artboard**. The panel menu has **New Artboard**, **Duplicate Artboards**, **Delete Artboards**, **Rename**, **Delete Empty Artboards**, **Convert to Artboards**, **Artboard Options…**, **Rearrange All Artboards…** and **Fit to Artwork Bounds**.

**Artboard Options** sets an artboard's name and **Background Color**, and three screen guides: **Show Center Mark**, **Show Cross Hairs** and **Show Video Safe Areas**. The background color and these guides show on the canvas only. They do not appear in exports or prints. To open Artboard Options with the Artboard tool, double-click an empty part of the artboard. [Set artboard options](#set-artboard-options) lists every option in the dialog.

Click a row to make that artboard the active one. Double-click a row's number to also fit that artboard in the window.

:::tip
Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) **New Artboard** in the Artboards panel to set the new artboard's options before VectorCraft adds it.
:::

## Set artboard options

The **Artboard Options** dialog sets the size, position, name and screen marks of the active artboard.

1. Open the dialog in one of these ways:
   - Double-click the **Artboard** tool in the Tools panel.
   - With the Artboard tool, double-click an empty part of the artboard. A double-click on an object does not open the dialog.
   - Choose **Artboard Options…** from the Artboards panel menu, or click the options icon at the right end of the active artboard's row.
   - With the Artboard tool, click **Resize** on the Contextual Task Bar.
2. Change the options in the following table.
3. Click **OK**. VectorCraft applies the changes as one step, which **Edit → Undo** reverses.

![The Artboard tool has the Front postcard artboard selected, with its handles and the Contextual Task Bar below it, and the Artboard Options dialog is open over the Front, Back and Stamp artboards. The dialog shows Preset Postcard with the landscape button on, Name Front, Width 6 in, Height 4 in, X 3 in and Y 2 in at the center reference point, Background Color None, the three Show checkboxes off and Video Ruler Pixel Aspect Ratio 1](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/artboard-options.webp)

| Option | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Preset** | Sets the size from a New Document preset, listed by category. A preset keeps each artboard's own orientation. **Fit to Artwork Bounds** and **Fit to Selected Art** at the top of the list resize the artboard around the art without moving the art. The list shows **Custom** when the size matches no preset | The preset that matches the size |
| Portrait and Landscape buttons | Swap the width and height when the artboard is in the other orientation | Set by the width and height |
| **Name** | Sets the artboard's name, which the Artboards panel and the status bar show | Artboard 1, Artboard 2 and so on |
| **Width** and **Height** | Set the size, in the document's units. The reference point stays where it is | The current size |
| Reference point locator | Chooses the point of the artboard that **X** and **Y** describe | Center |
| **X** and **Y** | Place the reference point at this position on the rulers, counted from the ruler origin | The current position |
| **Background Color** | Paints the artboard: **None**, **White** or **Black**, or any color from the swatch beside the list, which shows **Custom** in the list | None |
| **Show Center Mark** | Draws a mark at the center of the artboard | Off |
| **Show Cross Hairs** | Draws a line from the middle of each side through the center | Off |
| **Show Video Safe Areas** | Draws the action-safe area and the title-safe area, 3.5% and 5% in from the edges | Off |
| **Video Ruler Pixel Aspect Ratio** | Sets the width of one video pixel compared with its height, which **View → Rulers → Show Video Rulers** counts in. The range is 0.1 to 10 | 1 |

Exports and prints draw the background color behind the art. The center mark, cross hairs and video safe areas show on the canvas only. When several artboards are selected with the Artboard tool, a preset, an orientation or a new width or height goes to each of them.

## Fit and rearrange artboards

The **Object → Artboards** menu has four commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Convert to Artboards** | Turns the bounds of each selected object into a new artboard and removes the objects. |
| **Rearrange All Artboards…** | Lays all artboards out again in their panel order. |
| **Fit to Artwork Bounds** | Resizes each selected artboard to the visible art on it. An artboard with no art stays as it is. |
| **Fit to Selected Art** | Resizes the active artboard to the selected art, strokes included. |

**Rearrange All Artboards** opens with **Layout** set to **Grid by Row**, 2 **Columns**, 20 pt **Spacing** and **Move Artwork with Artboard** on. The dialog keeps the spacing you confirmed last time. **Layout Order** switches between left-to-right and right-to-left.

To lay out the artboards again:

1. Choose **Object → Artboards → Rearrange All Artboards…**. You can also click **Rearrange All Artboards** at the bottom of the Artboards panel, or **Rearrange All** in the Properties panel or on the Contextual Task Bar. The command needs at least two artboards.
2. Click a **Layout** button and a **Layout Order** button.
3. Type the number of **Columns** and the **Spacing** between artboards.
4. Click **OK**. The artboards move in their panel order, as one step that **Edit → Undo** reverses.

![The Rearrange All Artboards dialog over six postcard artboards set out unevenly in two staggered rows, with the Artboards panel listing Front, Back, Stamp, Inside Left, Inside Right and Envelope and Front highlighted. The dialog shows Layout set to Grid by Row, the left-to-right Layout Order, Columns 3, Spacing 0.5 in, Move Artwork with Artboard turned on and Artboards: 6](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/rearrange-artboards.webp)

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Layout** | **Grid by Row** fills each row before the next one. **Grid by Column** fills each column before the next one. **Arrange by Row** puts every artboard in one row, and **Arrange by Column** puts every artboard in one column |
| **Layout Order** | **Change to Left-to-Right Layout** places the first artboard on the left, and **Change to Right-to-Left Layout** places it on the right. The order buttons are unavailable with Arrange by Column |
| **Columns** | Sets how many artboards go in each row, from 1 to the number of artboards. With Grid by Column the field is **Rows**. The field is unavailable with Arrange by Row and Arrange by Column |
| **Spacing** | Sets the gap between artboards, in the document's units |
| **Move Artwork with Artboard** | Moves the art on each artboard with it. Turn it off to move only the artboards |
| **Artboards** | Shows how many artboards the document has |

:::note
A locked artboard keeps its size and position. You lock an artboard in the Artboards panel's lock column. Rearrange All Artboards and Fit to Artwork Bounds leave a locked artboard where it is, and the Artboard tool does not move or delete it.
:::

## Set units, bleed and paper

Choose **File → Document Setup…** (**Ctrl+Alt+P**, or **Cmd+Option+P** on macOS). The dialog has **General**, **Transparency** and **Type** tabs. **OK** applies the settings of all three tabs as one step.

| Tab | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **General** | **Units** | Sets the unit the document shows lengths in. |
| **General** | **Bleed** | Sets the bleed on each side, from 0 to 72 pt. |
| **General** | **Edit Artboards** | Applies the settings, closes the dialog and switches to the Artboard tool. |
| **General** | **Show Images in Outline Mode** | Shows the pixels of placed images in Outline view. Off by default. |
| **General** | **Highlight Substituted Glyphs** | Highlights characters that the font does not have and that VectorCraft draws from a fallback font. Off by default. |
| **Transparency** | **Grid Size** and **Grid Colors** | Set the checkerboard that shows behind transparent areas. **Grid Size** is Small, Medium (the default) or Large. **Grid Colors** is Light (the default), Medium, Dark, Red, Orange, Green, Blue or Purple, or Custom after you type your own two colors. |
| **Transparency** | **Simulate Colored Paper** | Draws the artboards in the paper color, which is the first of the two grid colors. |
| **Transparency** | **Preset** under **Export and Clipboard Transparency Flattener Settings** | Chooses a flattener preset: High Resolution, Medium Resolution (the default), Low Resolution or one you saved. |
| **Transparency** | **Discard White Overprint in Output** | Makes white objects set to overprint knock out in PDF output, in print and in the overprint preview. On by default. |
| **Type** | **Language** | Sets the document's language, English: USA by default. Choosing a language also sets its quote characters. |
| **Type** | **Double Quotes** and **Single Quotes** | Set the opening and closing quote characters. |
| **Type** | **Use Typographer's Quotes** | Turns straight quotes you type into the document's quote characters. On by default. |
| **Type** | **Superscript** and **Subscript** **Size** and **Position** | Set the size and the baseline shift of superscript and subscript characters, as a percentage of the font size. Both default to 58.3% size and 33.3% position. Size runs from 1% to 500%, and position from -500% to 500%. |
| **Type** | **Small Caps** | Sets the size of small capitals that VectorCraft makes from capitals, as a percentage of the font size: 70% by default, from 1% to 200%. |
| **Type** | **Export** | **Preserve Text Editability** (the default) writes type to SVG as text. **Preserve Text Appearance** writes it as outlines. |

To print one artboard on several sheets, see [Print a large poster](/apps/vectorcraft/print-tiling/). For the flattener presets, see [Manage color and proof for print](/apps/vectorcraft/manage-color-and-proof/#flatten-transparency-for-printing).

## Choose the color mode

The color mode is set when you create the document. To change it later, choose **File → Document Color Mode → CMYK Color** or **File → Document Color Mode → RGB Color**. VectorCraft converts the colors in the document, including swatches, symbols, brushes and graphic styles, in one step.

:::caution
The conversion changes the stored color values of the artwork. If the result is not what you want, choose **Edit → Undo** to restore the original colors.
:::

## Move around the canvas

- The **Hand** tool (H) pans the view when you drag. With any tool, hold Space and drag, or drag with the middle mouse button.
- The **Zoom** tool (Z) zooms in with a click. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) and click to zoom out. With any tool, hold **Ctrl+Space** (**Cmd+Space** on macOS) and click to zoom in.
- Double-click the Hand tool to fit the artboard in the window. Double-click the Zoom tool to show the document at 100%.
- The mouse wheel scrolls the view. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) while you turn the wheel to zoom in or out at the pointer. Hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) to scroll sideways, or **Ctrl+Alt** (**Cmd+Option** on macOS) to zoom.
- On a trackpad, pinch to zoom and drag with two fingers to scroll. A two-finger scroll with **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) held zooms at the pointer. On a touch screen, pinch to zoom and drag with two fingers to pan.
- On a Mac trackpad, turn two fingers to rotate the view. **Preferences → General → Trackpad Gesture to Rotate View** turns this on and off. It is on by default.

To make Ctrl-wheel (Cmd-wheel on macOS) zoom at the pointer, turn off **Scroll Sideways with Cmd/Ctrl + Wheel** in **Preferences → General**. It is on by default. The setting applies to a mouse wheel only. A trackpad scroll with **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) held zooms whether the setting is on or off.

To make the plain wheel zoom, turn on **Zoom with Mouse Wheel** in **Preferences → General**. The wheel and Alt-wheel then zoom, Shift-wheel scrolls up and down, and Ctrl-wheel (Cmd-wheel on macOS) scrolls sideways. **Scroll Sideways with Cmd/Ctrl + Wheel** is unavailable while **Zoom with Mouse Wheel** is on. See [General](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#general) in Preferences.

You can also move the view from the status bar at the bottom of the window:

- The zoom menu at the left end shows the zoom level. Pick a zoom from 3.13% to 64000%, or pick **Fit on Screen** or **Fit All**.
- The angle menu beside it turns the view to a preset angle.
- The artboard navigator has **First Artboard**, **Previous Artboard**, a list of the artboards by number and name, **Next Artboard** and **Last Artboard**. Going to an artboard fits it in the window, and it becomes the artboard that **Fit Artboard in Window** and **Actual Size** show.

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Fit Artboard in Window** | Ctrl+0 | Cmd+0 |
| **Fit All in Window** | Ctrl+Alt+0 | Cmd+Option+0 |
| **Actual Size** | Ctrl+1 | Cmd+1 |
| **Zoom In** | Ctrl+= | Cmd+= |
| **Zoom Out** | Ctrl+- | Cmd+- |
| **Show Rulers** | Ctrl+R | Cmd+R |
| **Hide Guides** | Ctrl+; | Cmd+; |
| **Smart Guides** | Ctrl+U | Cmd+U |
| **Show Grid** | Ctrl+' | Cmd+' |
| **Snap to Grid** | Ctrl+Shift+' | Cmd+Shift+' |
| **Hide Artboards** | Ctrl+Shift+H | Cmd+Shift+H |
| **Outline** | Ctrl+Y | Cmd+Y |

These commands are in the **View** menu and its **Rulers** and **Guides** submenus. **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…** changes them.

The Navigator panel and the Rotate View tool are described in [Customize the workspace](/apps/vectorcraft/customize-the-workspace/#move-around-with-the-navigator-and-rotate-the-view).

## Use rulers, guides and grids

Rulers measure positions on the canvas. Guides are lines that art snaps to. The grid is a pattern of lines behind the art.

1. Choose **View → Rulers → Show Rulers** (**Ctrl+R**, or **Cmd+R** on macOS). The rulers appear along the top and the left of the canvas.
2. To measure in another unit, right-click a ruler or the box where the rulers meet, and pick a unit. The document's units change, as in **Preferences → Units**.
3. To make a horizontal guide, drag from the top ruler onto the canvas. To make a vertical guide, drag from the left ruler. The guide is placed where you release the mouse button, and a readout shows its position.
4. To move the zero point of the rulers, drag from the box where the rulers meet to a point on the canvas. Double-click the box to put the zero point back. Press Escape during the drag to cancel it.

![A dusk mountain lake postcard named Front at 200%, with the rulers in inches counting from the artboard's top-left corner and the grid around the artboard. A vertical guide runs at the 0.5 in mark, a horizontal guide is being dragged down with a Y: 1.00 in readout beside it, and the status bar shows 200% with the navigator on 1 Front](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/rulers-and-guides.webp)

While you drag a guide out of a ruler, hold Shift to snap it to the ruler's tick marks, or hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to switch between a horizontal and a vertical guide. With the Artboard tool, the new guide belongs to the active artboard.

With the Selection tool, click a guide to select it and drag it to move it. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) while you drag to move a copy. Drop a guide on its ruler to delete it.

Each ruler guide is an object on a layer. A new guide goes on the current layer, above the art in that layer, and the Layers panel lists it in that layer as **\<Horizontal Guide\>** or **\<Vertical Guide\>**. When you hide, lock or delete the layer, its guides are hidden, locked or deleted with it, and a guide on a hidden or locked layer can't be selected. To move guides to another layer, drag their rows onto that layer's row in the Layers panel. For the Layers panel, see [Organize with layers and symbols](/apps/vectorcraft/organize-with-layers-and-symbols/#work-in-the-layers-panel).

![A magazine cover named DUSK with a violet sky, a coral title, a setting sun and teal hills, crossed by ruler guides. A horizontal guide is being dragged down with a Y: 248.31 pt readout beside it, the Layers panel lists two Vertical Guide rows and three Horizontal Guide rows in the Guides layer above the Type, Hills and Background layers, and the Snapping menu on the Control bar is open with Snap to Glyph off and Alignment Guides on](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/guides-on-layers.webp)

**View → Rulers** has three commands:

- **Show Rulers** shows the rulers. The command reads **Hide Rulers** while they show.
- **Change to Global Rulers** (**Ctrl+Alt+R**, or **Cmd+Option+R** on macOS) measures the whole document from one zero point. A new document uses artboard rulers, which measure from the top-left corner of the active artboard. While global rulers are on, the command reads **Change to Artboard Rulers**. The document keeps the setting when you save it.
- **Show Video Rulers** counts the active artboard in video pixels from its top-left corner. Each pixel is as wide as the artboard's **Video Ruler Pixel Aspect Ratio** and one point tall.

**View → Guides** has five commands:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hide Guides** | Ctrl+; | Cmd+; | Hides all guides. The command then reads **Show Guides** |
| **Lock Guides** | Ctrl+Alt+; | Cmd+Option+; | Stops you from selecting or moving guides. The command then reads **Unlock Guides** |
| **Make Guides** | Ctrl+5 | Cmd+5 | Turns the selected paths into guides |
| **Release Guides** | Ctrl+Alt+5 | Cmd+Option+5 | Turns the selected guides into paths with no fill or stroke. With no guide selected, it releases every guide that was made from a path |
| **Clear Guides** | None | None | Deletes every guide in the document |

**Make Guides** is also in the menu that opens when you right-click selected objects. When you right-click an empty part of the canvas, the menu has **Show Rulers**, **Show Grid**, **Hide Guides** and **Lock Guides**.

Two settings in **Preferences → Guides & Grid** change how guides behave. Both are off by default.

- **Lock Guides by Default** starts VectorCraft with **View → Guides → Lock Guides** on. Changing the setting locks or unlocks the guides at once. **Lock Guides** in the View menu changes the lock for the current session only and does not change the setting. A guide you drag out of a ruler while guides are locked is locked too.
- With **Artboard Guides with Cmd/Ctrl + Ruler Drag** on, hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) as you start to drag out of a ruler to make the other kind of guide. With any tool except the Artboard tool, the new guide belongs to the active artboard and runs across that artboard only. With the Artboard tool, the new guide runs across the whole canvas.

The grid and the snapping commands are in the **View** menu:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Show Grid** | Ctrl+' | Cmd+' | Shows the grid. The command then reads **Hide Grid** | Off |
| **Snap to Grid** | Ctrl+Shift+' | Cmd+Shift+' | Snaps art you draw and move to the grid lines | Off |
| **Snap to Pixel** | None | None | Places art you draw and move on whole pixels | Off |
| **Snap to Point** | Ctrl+Alt+' | Cmd+Option+' | Snaps the pointer to anchor points | On |
| **Snap to Glyph** | None | None | Snaps art you draw to the bounds of live type, and on a single line of type to its baseline, x-height, character widths and glyph anchor points | Off |
| **Smart Guides** | Ctrl+U | Cmd+U | Shows temporary guides and snaps to the edges, centers and anchor points of art and artboards | On |

The **Snapping** menu at the left of the Control bar has **Smart Guides**, **Snap to Point**, **Snap to Grid**, **Snap to Pixel** and **Snap to Glyph**, then **Alignment Guides**, **Snap to Tangent** and **Snap to Perpendicular**. **Alignment Guides** is the same setting as **Preferences → Smart Guides → Alignment Guides**, and it is on by default. To show the Control bar, choose **Window → Control**. In a narrow window, the Control bar leaves the Snapping menu out while the Artboard tool is active. To set up the grid and snap art to it, see [Draw on the grid](/apps/vectorcraft/draw-on-the-grid/).

The grid spacing, the grid and guide colors and the Smart Guides options are in [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/): see [Guides & Grid](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#guides--grid), [Smart Guides](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#smart-guides) and [Units](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#units).

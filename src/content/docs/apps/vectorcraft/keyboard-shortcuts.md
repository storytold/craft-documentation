This page lists every keyboard shortcut VectorCraft has by default, for Windows and Linux and for macOS. Where Windows and Linux use Ctrl, macOS uses Cmd, and where they use Alt, macOS uses Option.

Two menu items are grayed out because they do not work yet, but they still show a shortcut: **Edit → Spelling → Check Spelling…** (**Ctrl+I**, or **Cmd+I** on macOS) and **Help → VectorCraft Help…** (**F1**). Pressing those keys does not run anything, so the tables below leave them out.

## Change a shortcut

1. Choose **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…**, or press **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K** (**Cmd+Option+Shift+K** on macOS).
2. Choose the **Tools** tab or the **Menu Commands** tab, and type part of a name in the search box. Panels are listed under Window on the **Menu Commands** tab, and each item of the Effect menu is listed too.
3. Click the shortcut next to an entry, then press the new keys. Press Esc to cancel. If another entry already uses those keys, VectorCraft removes them from that entry and tells you which one.
4. Click **OK** to keep the changes, or **Cancel** to discard them.

The **Set** list offers **VectorCraft Defaults** and **Classic Defaults**. Both sets have the same shortcuts, the ones listed on this page. After you change a shortcut, the list shows **Custom**. **Clear** removes the selected entry's shortcut, **Use Default** gives it back its default, and **Reset to Defaults** returns every shortcut to the defaults. **Export…** saves your set as a `.json` file, and **Import…** reads one back. [Automate VectorCraft](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/) describes every button of the dialog.

![The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog after P was pressed for the Smart Pen Tool. The Set list shows Custom, the Pen Tool now has no shortcut, and a red message under the list says P was already used by the Pen Tool and has been removed there](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-conflict.webp)

To run a command without its shortcut, choose **Help → Search Commands…**, or press **Ctrl+Shift+/** (**Cmd+Shift+/** on macOS). Type part of a command's or a tool's name, then press Enter. The list shows each match's shortcut beside it.

![Search Commands open over a harbor scene with a sailboat selected. The search box holds "paste", and the list shows Paste, Paste in Front, Paste in Back, Paste in Place and the other paste commands with their shortcuts, such as Ctrl+F and Ctrl+B](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-search-commands.webp)

While you type text with the Type tool, only shortcuts that use Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) work. Tool keys, panel keys such as F7 and Shift+F7, and Tab do not. In that mode, **Ctrl+Shift+B** (**Cmd+Shift+B** on macOS) runs **Type → Bold** in place of **View → Hide Bounding Box**, and **Ctrl+Shift+I** (**Cmd+Shift+I** on macOS) runs **Type → Italic** in place of **View → Perspective Grid → Show Grid**.

## Tools

Press a tool's key to select it. To use a tool for a moment, hold its key instead (see [Hold a tool's key](#hold-a-tools-key)). Tools that are not listed here have no default key, and you can give them one.

![The Pen tool is selected in the toolbar, and its tooltip reads Pen Tool (P). A white gull is being drawn in the sky above a lighthouse and a sailboat, and the status bar shows the Pen tool's hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-tool-tooltip.webp)

|---|---|---|
| New… | Ctrl+N | Cmd+N |
| New from Template… | Ctrl+Shift+N | Cmd+Shift+N |
| Open… | Ctrl+O | Cmd+O |
| Close | Ctrl+W | Cmd+W |
| Close All | Ctrl+Alt+W | Cmd+Option+W |
| Save | Ctrl+S | Cmd+S |
| Save As… | Ctrl+Shift+S | Cmd+Shift+S |
| Save a Copy… | Ctrl+Alt+S | Cmd+Option+S |
| Revert | F12 | F12 |
| Place… | Ctrl+Shift+P | Cmd+Shift+P |

| Scripts → Other Script… | Ctrl+F12 | Cmd+F12 |
| Print… | Ctrl+P | Cmd+P |
| Exit | Ctrl+Q | Cmd+Q |

On macOS, Exit is **VectorCraft → Quit VectorCraft**.

**Other Script…** asks for a `.js` or `.jsx` file and runs it. Before the script runs, VectorCraft shows a warning, unless you have turned that warning off. [Run scripts](/apps/vectorcraft/run-scripts/) describes the Scripts menu and the warning.

**Ctrl+Alt+N** (**Cmd+Option+N** on macOS) makes a new document without opening the New Document dialog. The document uses the settings the dialog would open with. This shortcut has no menu item.

## Edit

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Undo | Ctrl+Z | Cmd+Z |
| Redo | Ctrl+Shift+Z | Cmd+Shift+Z |
| Cut | Ctrl+X or F2 | Cmd+X |
| Copy | Ctrl+C or F3 | Cmd+C |
| Paste | Ctrl+V or F4 | Cmd+V |
| Paste in Front | Ctrl+F | Cmd+F |
| Paste in Back | Ctrl+B | Cmd+B |
| Paste in Place | Ctrl+Shift+V | Cmd+Shift+V |
| Paste on All Artboards | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V | Cmd+Option+Shift+V |
| Paste without Formatting | Ctrl+Alt+V | Cmd+Option+V |
| Clear | Delete | Delete |
| Color Settings… | Ctrl+Shift+K | Cmd+Shift+K |
| Keyboard Shortcuts… | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K | Cmd+Option+Shift+K |
| Preferences… | Ctrl+K | Cmd+K |

On Windows and Linux, F2, F3 and F4 also cut, copy and paste. If you give one of those keys to another command in **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…**, Cut, Copy or Paste keeps only its Ctrl shortcut. [Copy and paste between apps](/apps/vectorcraft/copy-and-paste-between-apps/) describes each paste command and what the clipboard holds.

Backspace also deletes the selected objects. On macOS, Preferences is **VectorCraft → Settings**, and **Cmd+,** opens it too. See [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/) for every setting.

## Type

These Type menu commands have shortcuts:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Create Outlines | Ctrl+Shift+O | Cmd+Shift+O |
| Show Hidden Characters | Ctrl+Alt+I | Cmd+Option+I |

These Type menu commands have shortcuts only while you edit text with the Type tool:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Bold | Ctrl+Shift+B | Cmd+Shift+B |
| Italic | Ctrl+Shift+I | Cmd+Shift+I |

Outside the text, the same keys run **View → Hide Bounding Box** and **View → Perspective Grid → Show Grid**.

The following shortcuts work on the selected type, or on the text you have selected with the Type tool, and have no menu item:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Increase Font Size | Ctrl+Shift+. | Cmd+Shift+. |
| Decrease Font Size | Ctrl+Shift+, | Cmd+Shift+, |
| Increase Font Size by Five Steps | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+. | Cmd+Option+Shift+. |
| Decrease Font Size by Five Steps | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+, | Cmd+Option+Shift+, |
| Reset Tracking and Kerning | Ctrl+Alt+Q | Cmd+Option+Q |
| Reset Horizontal Scale | Ctrl+Shift+X | Cmd+Shift+X |
| Align left | Ctrl+Shift+L | Cmd+Shift+L |
| Align center | Ctrl+Shift+C | Cmd+Shift+C |
| Align right | Ctrl+Shift+R | Cmd+Shift+R |
| Justify with last line aligned left | Ctrl+Shift+J | Cmd+Shift+J |
| Justify all lines | Ctrl+Shift+F | Cmd+Shift+F |

| Highlight Font Name | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F | Cmd+Option+Shift+F |
| Highlight Kerning | Ctrl+Alt+K | Cmd+Option+K |
| Toggle Line Composer | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C | Cmd+Option+Shift+C |
| Hyphenate | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H | Cmd+Option+Shift+H |

One font size step is the **Size/Leading** increment on the Type page of Preferences. **Highlight Font Name** opens the font menu of the Character panel with its search field ready for typing, and **Highlight Kerning** puts the cursor in the panel's Kerning field.

While you edit horizontal text with the Type tool, these keys change the text:

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| Alt+Left Arrow, Alt+Right Arrow | Change the kerning at the cursor, or the tracking of the selected text |
| Alt+Up Arrow, Alt+Down Arrow | Change the leading |
| Alt+Shift+Up Arrow, Alt+Shift+Down Arrow | Change the baseline shift |

Add Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) to change the value by five steps. On macOS, press Option in place of Alt.

![The title Harbor Lights is open in the Type tool with the word Lights selected. The Character panel floats beside the sailboat and shows a tracking of 60 after Alt+Right Arrow was pressed three times](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-type-tracking.webp)

## Select

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| All | Ctrl+A | Cmd+A |
| All on Active Artboard | Ctrl+Alt+A | Cmd+Option+A |

## Effect

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Apply Last Effect | Ctrl+Shift+E | Cmd+Shift+E |
| Last Effect… | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E | Cmd+Option+Shift+E |

**Last Effect…** opens the dialog of the last effect you applied. The effects in the menu have no default shortcuts, and you can give any of them one in **Edit → Keyboard Shortcuts…**.

## View

![The View menu open over a harbor scene with a selected sailboat. Commands that have a shortcut show it on the right, such as Ctrl+Y for Outline, Ctrl+0 for Fit Artboard in Window and Ctrl+Shift+B for Hide Bounding Box](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-view-menu.webp)

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|

| Guides → Release Guides | Ctrl+Alt+5 | Cmd+Option+5 |
| Smart Guides | Ctrl+U | Cmd+U |
| Perspective Grid → Show Grid | Ctrl+Shift+I | Cmd+Shift+I |
| Show Grid | Ctrl+' | Cmd+' |
| Snap to Grid | Ctrl+Shift+' | Cmd+Shift+' |
| Snap to Point | Ctrl+Alt+' | Cmd+Option+' |

While you edit text with the Type tool, **Ctrl+Shift+B** and **Ctrl+Shift+I** (**Cmd+Shift+B** and **Cmd+Shift+I** on macOS) run **Type → Bold** and **Type → Italic** instead of **Hide Bounding Box** and **Perspective Grid → Show Grid**. F steps through the three modes of **View → Screen Mode**. Commands that show or hide something change their name to match, for example **Hide Edges** becomes **Show Edges**. On macOS, **Cmd+H** is Hide Edges, and **Ctrl+Cmd+H** hides VectorCraft.

**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+U** (**Cmd+Option+Shift+U** on macOS) switches the document to the next unit: Points, Picas, Inches, Millimeters, Centimeters, Pixels, Feet & Inches, Meters, Yards and Feet, then Points again. This shortcut has no menu item.

## Window and panels

Each of these keys shows its panel, or hides it when it is already showing.

![F7 has brought the Layers panel forward, with the Lighthouse layer expanded, and Shift+F7 has opened the Align panel as a floating panel beside a selected sailboat](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-panel-keys.webp)

| Panel | Windows and Linux | macOS |

| Pathfinder | Ctrl+Shift+F9 | Cmd+Shift+F9 |
| Stroke | Ctrl+F10 | Cmd+F10 |
| Transparency | Ctrl+Shift+F10 | Cmd+Shift+F10 |
| Attributes | Ctrl+F11 | Cmd+F11 |
| Symbols | Ctrl+Shift+F11 | Cmd+Shift+F11 |

| Type → Paragraph | Ctrl+Alt+T | Cmd+Option+T |
| Type → Tabs | Ctrl+Shift+T | Cmd+Shift+T |
| Type → OpenType | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T | Cmd+Option+Shift+T |

These shortcuts run panel commands or switch the window layout:

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Hide or show the panels, the toolbar and the Control bar | Tab | Tab |
| Hide or show the panels only | Shift+Tab | Shift+Tab |
| Next document | Ctrl+F6 | Cmd+F6 |
| Previous document | Ctrl+Shift+F6 | Cmd+Shift+F6 |
| New Layer… (Layers panel) | Ctrl+L | Cmd+L |
| New Layer Options… (Layers panel) | Ctrl+Alt+L | Cmd+Option+L |
| Add New Fill (Appearance panel) | Ctrl+/ | Cmd+/ |
| Add New Stroke (Appearance panel) | Ctrl+Alt+/ | Cmd+Option+/ |
| Repeat the last Pathfinder operation | Ctrl+4 | Cmd+4 |
| Symbol Options… (Symbols panel) | F8 | F8 |

With objects selected, F8 opens Symbol Options for a new symbol. [Panels](/apps/vectorcraft/panels/) lists every panel in the Window menu, and [Customize the workspace](/apps/vectorcraft/customize-the-workspace/) covers arranging panels and saving workspaces.

## Keys while you draw

### Shape tools

These keys work while you drag with the Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star or Line Segment tool.

![The Star tool part way through a drag in the sky. Up Arrow has raised the star to 11 points, the R1 and R2 readout shows the two radii, and the status bar shows the Star tool's hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/keyboard-shortcuts-star-points.webp)

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| Shift | Draws a square or a circle, or keeps a line to a multiple of 45° |
| Alt (Option on macOS) | Draws the shape out from its center |
| Space, held during the drag | Moves the shape you are drawing, while you keep the mouse button down |
| Up Arrow, Down Arrow | Adds or removes a Polygon side or a Star point (3 to 1000), or changes a Rounded Rectangle's corner radius by 1 (0 to 1296 pt) |
| Ctrl (Cmd on macOS), Star tool | Keeps the inner radius where it is while the outer radius follows the pointer |
| Alt (Option on macOS), Star tool | Keeps the star's shoulders straight |
| Esc | Cancels the shape |

### Pen, Curvature and Pencil

These keys work while you draw a path. [Draw and edit paths](/apps/vectorcraft/draw-and-edit-paths/) describes each tool.

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| Alt (Option on macOS), Pen tool drag | Breaks the handles, so only the outgoing handle follows the pointer |
| Shift, Pen tool | Keeps the handle at 45° steps |
| Space, held during a Pen tool drag | Moves the anchor point together with its handles |
| Enter or Esc, Pen or Curvature tool | Ends the path and leaves it open |
| Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) or double-click, Curvature tool | Switches a point between corner and smooth |
| Backspace or Delete, Curvature tool | Removes the point you last placed or moved |
| Alt (Option on macOS) as you release, Pencil tool | Closes the path |
| Shift as you press, Pencil tool | Draws a straight line at 45° steps |

### Any tool

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| Space, held before you press the mouse button | Switches to the Hand tool while you hold it |
| Space+Shift, held before you press | Switches to the Rotate View tool |
| Ctrl+Space (Cmd+Space on macOS), held before you press | Switches to the Zoom tool; add Alt (Option) to zoom out |
| Ctrl (Cmd on macOS), held | Switches to the selection tool you used last for one drag, except with the Hand, Zoom or Rotate View tool |
| Arrow keys | Move the selection by the **Keyboard Increment** in Preferences (1 pt by default) |
| Shift+arrow keys | Move the selection ten times as far |
| Alt+arrow keys (Option on macOS) | Move a copy of the selection |
| Shift+D | Steps through the drawing modes: Draw Normal, Draw Behind, Draw Inside |

Before you have chosen a selection tool, Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) switches the Pen, Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point, Anchor Point and Curvature tools to Direct Selection, and the other tools to Selection. With the Direct Selection tool, Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) switches to Selection, and Ctrl+Alt (Cmd+Option on macOS) switches to Group Selection. The Selection and Group Selection tools do not switch.

### Hold a tool's key

To use a tool briefly and then return to the tool you were using:

1. Press and hold a tool's key from the [Tools](#tools) table, for example R for the Rotate tool.
2. While you hold the key, drag or click with that tool.
3. Release the key. VectorCraft switches back to the tool you had before.

A quick press selects the tool and keeps it. If you hold the key for a quarter of a second or longer, VectorCraft switches back when you release it, even if you did not use the tool. If you release the key in the middle of a drag, VectorCraft switches back when the drag ends.

This works while **Hold a Tool Shortcut to Use the Tool Temporarily** is on, under **Options** on the General page of [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/). It is on by default. With it off, every press of a tool's key selects the tool and keeps it.

### Brushes and symbol tools

| Keys | What they do |
|---|---|
| [ and ] | Make the Blob Brush or the Eraser smaller or larger by 1 (1 to 1000) |
| [ and ] | Make the brush of a symbol tool smaller or larger by 10 (2 to 2000) |
| Shift+[ and Shift+] | Lower or raise a symbol tool's intensity (1 to 10) |

### Fill and stroke

| Command | Windows and Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| Default fill and stroke (white fill, 1 pt black stroke; type gets a black fill and no stroke) | D | D |
| Switch between the Fill and Stroke boxes | X | X |
| Swap fill and stroke | Shift+X | Shift+X |
| Set the active box to None | / | / |
| Apply the last color | , or Shift+, | , or Shift+, |
| Apply the last gradient | . or Shift+. | . or Shift+. |
| Stroke weight up | Ctrl+Alt+. | Cmd+Option+. |
| Stroke weight down | Ctrl+Alt+, | Cmd+Option+, |

This guide shows how to set the language of type, turn on the East Asian type options, build composite fonts for Japanese text, and type a character by its code on Windows.

## Set the language of type

The language of type sets the letter forms that VectorCraft draws and the rules it uses to hyphenate words.

1. Select a type object, or select characters with the Type tool.
2. Open the Character panel with **Window → Type → Character** (**Ctrl+T**, or **Cmd+T** on macOS).
3. Choose a language from the **Language** menu at the foot of the panel. If you do not see the menu, choose **Show Options** in the panel menu.

VectorCraft shapes the selected characters in that language, so the font draws the letter forms it has for the language. For example, when you set Cyrillic text to **Bulgarian**, a font that has Bulgarian letter forms draws them.

Each run of characters also hyphenates in its own language:

- **English: USA** and **English: UK** use VectorCraft's English rules.
- **Hindi**, **Marathi**, **Gujarati**, **Bengali**, **Punjabi**, **Tamil**, **Telugu**, **Kannada**, **Malayalam**, **Odia** and **Assamese** use a set of hyphenation patterns for each language. A break never splits a letter cluster.
- In every other language, a word breaks only where the **Exceptions (comma separated)** list on the Hyphenation page of [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#hyphenation) marks it.

Auto Spell Check checks the characters against the dictionary for their language, as [Check spelling](/apps/vectorcraft/check-spelling/#check-type-in-another-language) describes.

The menu lists 37 languages: English: USA, English: UK, German, German: Swiss, French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Polish, Czech, Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian: Cyrillic, Serbian: Latin, Croatian, Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Assamese, Sanskrit and Urdu.

New type takes the language of the document, and **English: USA** is the default. When the selected characters have different languages, the menu is blank. When a file you open sets a language that is not in the list, the menu shows that language's tag.

## Show the East Asian options

The commands for Japanese and other East Asian type are hidden until you turn them on.

1. On Windows and Linux, choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**). On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → Type…**.
2. On the **Type** page, under **Language Options**, turn on **Show East Asian Options**.

The option is off by default. Turning it on adds these commands:

| Where | What appears |
|---|---|
| **Type** menu | **Composite Fonts…** |
| Character panel menu | **Character Alignment**, **Proportional Metrics**, **Tate-chu-yoko**, **Tate-chu-yoko Settings…** and **Standard Vertical Roman Alignment** |
| Paragraph panel | The **Mojikumi Set** and **Kinsoku Set** menus |
| Paragraph panel menu | **Top-to-Top Leading**, **Bottom-to-Bottom Leading**, **Burasagari** and **Kinsoku Shori Type** |

[Set vertical type](/apps/vectorcraft/work-with-styles-and-long-text/#set-vertical-type) shows how to set vertical lines and use the tate-chu-yoko commands. **Show Indic Options**, under the same heading, adds **Digits**, **Character Direction** and **Kashidas** to the Character panel menu, as [Set the font, size and spacing](/apps/vectorcraft/add-and-style-type/#set-the-font-size-and-spacing) describes. It also adds the **Left-to-Right Paragraph Direction** and **Right-to-Left Paragraph Direction** buttons and the **Insert Kashidas** menu to the Paragraph panel, as [Set paragraph options](/apps/vectorcraft/add-and-style-type/#set-paragraph-options) describes.

## Build a composite font

A composite font sets each class of character in a font of its own. Japanese text can then take its kanji and kana from a Japanese font, and its Latin letters and digits from a Latin font. VectorCraft saves the composite fonts with the document.

1. Open a document, and turn on **Show East Asian Options** as described in the previous section.
2. Choose **Type → Composite Fonts…**.
3. Click **New**. VectorCraft adds a composite font named **Composite Font 1** (or the next free number), based on the one picked in **Font**, and picks it.
4. Type a name in **Name**.
5. In each row of the table, choose the font and style for that class of character, and set its size, baseline and scales.
6. Click **OK**. VectorCraft applies every change as one undo step. **Cancel** closes the dialog and leaves the composite fonts as they were.
7. Select type, and choose the composite font by its name in the Character panel's font menu. The font menus list composite fonts first.

Kanji, Kana and Punctuation use Shippori Mincho, Symbols uses BIZ UDPGothic at 90%, Roman uses Source Serif 4 at 110% with a -2% baseline, and Numerals uses Source Sans 3 at 105% with a 95% horizontal scale](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/composite-fonts.webp)

The top of the dialog holds these controls:

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Font** | Picks the composite font to edit. It shows **None** when the document has no composite fonts. |
| **New** | Adds a composite font based on the one picked. With no composite fonts, the new font starts from the default type font. |
| **Delete Font** | Removes the composite font picked. Type set in it keeps its name and shows as a missing font. The button is dimmed when the document has no composite fonts. |
| **Import…** | Adds the composite fonts of a file, as described in [Share composite fonts](#share-composite-fonts). |
| **Export…** | Saves the composite font picked to a file. The button is dimmed when the document has no composite fonts. |
| **Name** | Sets the name of the composite font picked. |

The table has one row for each class of character:

| Class | Characters |
|---|---|
| **Kanji** | The base font: ideographs, full-width letters and digits, and every character that no other class takes |
| **Kana** | Hiragana and katakana, full-width and half-width |
| **Punctuation** | East Asian and full-width punctuation, and typographic quotes and dashes |
| **Symbols** | Arrows, math signs, shapes, enclosed characters and other symbols |
| **Roman** | Half-width Latin letters, their punctuation, and spaces |
| **Numerals** | The half-width digits 0 to 9 |

Each row has these columns:

| Column | What it sets | Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Font** and **Style** | The font family and style for the class. A composite font cannot be chosen here. | Any installed font |
| **Size** | The size of the characters, in percent of the type size | 10% to 400% |
| **Baseline** | How far the characters move up (positive) or down (negative), in percent of the type size | -100% to 100% |
| **Horizontal Scale** and **Vertical Scale** | The width and height of the characters. Only the Kana, Roman and Numerals rows have them. | 10% to 400% |
| **Scale at Center** | Scales the characters from the center of the em box instead of from the baseline. Only the Kana row has it. | On or off |

A new composite font copies every row of the one picked. When the document has no composite font yet, every row starts with the default type font at 100% size, a 0% baseline, 100% scales and **Scale at Center** off.

Each name must be unique, whatever its letter case, and cannot be the name of an installed font. A name can be up to 255 characters long and cannot contain control characters, and VectorCraft removes spaces from its start and end. A document can hold up to 256 composite fonts. When two composite fonts share a name, a name is empty, or a value is out of range, **OK** keeps the dialog open so you can fix it.

## Share composite fonts

Composite font files use the extension `.vccomposite`.

To save a composite font to a file:

1. Choose **Type → Composite Fonts…**.
2. Pick the composite font in **Font**.
3. Click **Export…** and choose where to save the file.

To add the composite fonts of a file to a document:

1. Open the document, and choose **Type → Composite Fonts…**.
2. Click **Import…** and choose a `.vccomposite` file. Its composite fonts join the list in the dialog, and the first one is picked. A composite font with the same name, whatever its letter case, is replaced.
3. Click **OK** to add the fonts to the document.

You can also open a `.vccomposite` file with **File → Open…**, or drop it on the VectorCraft window. Its composite fonts are added to the active document right away. VectorCraft reads files of up to 4 MB.

## Type a character by its code on Windows

On Windows, you can type a character by its decimal code with the numeric keypad, both while you edit type with the Type tool and in a panel's text fields.

1. Hold **Alt**.
2. Type the code on the numeric keypad. For example, type **0176** for the degree sign (°).
3. Release **Alt**. VectorCraft types the character in the same undo step as the text you are typing.

A code that starts with 0 types the character from the system's ANSI code page, and a code without a leading 0 types the character from its OEM code page. The codes work with NumLock on or off. While you hold Alt, the keypad digits do not run shortcuts. Alt codes work on Windows only.

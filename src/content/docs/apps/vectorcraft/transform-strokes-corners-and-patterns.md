This guide covers the settings that decide what changes with an object when you transform it: **Scale Strokes & Effects**, **Scale Corners**, **Transform Pattern Tiles**, the **Transform Objects** and **Transform Patterns** checkboxes in the transform dialogs, the Transform panel menu, the backtick key with the Selection tool, and **Reset Bounding Box**.

Shortcuts are written for Windows and Linux first, then macOS.

By default, a transform changes only the object's geometry:

| Setting | Off (default) | On |
|---|---|---|
| **Scale Strokes & Effects** | Stroke weights and effect distances stay the same | Stroke weights, dashes and effect distances scale with the object |
| **Scale Corners** | Live corner radii stay the same | Live corner radii scale with the object |
| **Transform Pattern Tiles** | Pattern fills and strokes stay where they are while the object moves over them | Pattern tiles move, scale and turn with the object |

All three settings are on the **General** page of Preferences. Open Preferences with **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**), or on macOS with **VectorCraft → Settings → General…** (**Cmd+K**). See [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/).

## Scale strokes and effects with an object

When **Scale Strokes & Effects** is on, a scale also changes:

- stroke weights;
- dash lengths and dash offsets;
- the distances in the effects on the object and on its fills and strokes, for example the offset of a drop shadow.

These values scale by the square root of the horizontal scale times the vertical scale. A uniform scale to 50% turns a 6 pt stroke into a 3 pt stroke. A scale of 200% wide by 50% high leaves the stroke weight at 6 pt. When the setting is off, the 6 pt stroke stays 6 pt at any size, and type keeps the weight of its character strokes.

To scale an object and its strokes by an exact amount:

1. Select the object with the Selection tool (**V**). See [Select and move objects](/apps/vectorcraft/select-and-move-objects/).
2. Choose **Object → Transform → Scale…**.
3. Type a value in **Horizontal %**. With **Uniform** checked, the vertical scale follows it.
4. Check **Scale Strokes & Effects**. Check **Scale Corners** as well to scale live corner radii.
5. Check **Preview** to see the result on the canvas before you confirm it.
6. Click **OK**.

The **Scale** and **Transform Each** dialogs open with **Scale Strokes & Effects** and **Scale Corners** set from the preferences. When you click **OK**, or **Copy** in **Transform Each**, the dialog saves both checkboxes back as the preferences, so the next drag with the Selection tool scales the same way.

You can change **Scale Strokes & Effects** in each of these places:

| Place | Control |
|---|---|
| Preferences, **General** page | **Scale Strokes & Effects** checkbox |
| Transform panel (**Window → Transform**, **Shift+F8**) | **Scale Strokes & Effects** checkbox below the fields, and the item of the same name in the panel menu |
| Properties panel, **Transform** section | **More Options** (…) button, then **Scale Strokes & Effects** |
| Properties panel with nothing selected | **Scale Strokes & Effects** in the **Preferences** section |
| **Object → Transform → Scale…** | **Scale Strokes & Effects** checkbox |
| **Object → Transform → Transform Each…** | **Scale Strokes & Effects** checkbox under **Options** |

Every one of these controls changes the same preference.

## Scale corner radii

**Scale Corners** sets whether live corners, such as the **Corner Radius** of a rectangle, scale with the object. When it is off, the radius keeps its value, so a badge that you scale down looks rounder. When it is on, the radius scales by the same factor as strokes.

You can change **Scale Corners** on the **General** page of Preferences, with the **Scale Corners** checkbox in the Transform panel, under **More Options** (…) in the **Transform** section of the Properties panel, and in the **Scale** and **Transform Each** dialogs.

## Transform patterns with the object or alone

An object filled or stroked with a pattern swatch has two parts that can move separately: the object's shape and the pattern tiles inside it. See [Make patterns, blends and repeats](/apps/vectorcraft/make-patterns-blends-and-repeats/) to make a pattern swatch, and [Fill, stroke and color](/apps/vectorcraft/fill-stroke-and-color/) to apply one.

The **Transform Pattern Tiles** preference sets what a transform does by default. It is off, so the tiles stay where they are when you move, scale or rotate the object.

The **Move**, **Rotate**, **Reflect**, **Scale**, **Shear** and **Transform Each** dialogs each have two checkboxes:

| Checkbox | Starts as | When checked |
|---|---|---|
| **Transform Objects** | Checked | The object's shape transforms |
| **Transform Patterns** | The **Transform Pattern Tiles** preference | Pattern fills and strokes transform with it |

To rotate only the pattern inside an object:

1. Select the object.
2. Choose **Object → Transform → Rotate…**.
3. Type an **Angle**.
4. Clear **Transform Objects** and check **Transform Patterns**.
5. Check **Preview** to see the tiles turn while the shape stays still.
6. Click **OK**.

The other dialogs work the same way: clear **Transform Objects** and check **Transform Patterns** to move, scale, reflect or shear only the tiles.

When you click **OK** in the **Move** dialog, its **Transform Patterns** choice becomes the **Transform Pattern Tiles** preference. The **Move** dialog also opens with **Copy**, **Transform Objects** and **Preview** as you last confirmed them. **Rotate**, **Reflect**, **Scale** and **Shear** open with **Preview** off and do not change the preference. **Transform Each** remembers **Transform Objects**, and its **Transform Patterns** starts from the preference each time it opens.

## Choose what the Transform panel changes

The Transform panel menu sets what the panel's fields and flip buttons change.

1. Open the Transform panel with **Window → Transform** (**Shift+F8**).
2. Click the panel menu button at the top right of the panel.
3. Choose one of the three items in the middle group.

| Menu item | A change in the panel transforms |
|---|---|
| **Transform Object Only** | The object. Its pattern fills and strokes stay as they are. |
| **Transform Pattern Only** | The pattern tiles alone. The object keeps its shape and place. |
| **Transform Both** | The object and its pattern tiles. |

![The Transform panel menu open next to a pattern-filled tote bag. The menu lists Hide Options, Flip Horizontal, Flip Vertical, Scale Strokes & Effects (checked), Measure Type by Glyph Bounds, Transform Object Only, Transform Pattern Only (checked), Transform Both, Use Registration Point for Symbol and Float Panel. The panel shows X 480 pt, Y 360 pt, W 360 pt and H 280 pt](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/transform-strokes-corners-and-patterns-panel-menu.webp)

Until you choose one, the panel follows the **Transform Pattern Tiles** preference. The menu then shows a check mark next to **Transform Both** when the preference is on, and next to **Transform Object Only** when it is off. The choice also applies to the **Transform** section of the Properties panel, and it stays set until you choose another item.

## Move, scale or rotate only the pattern with the Selection tool (backtick)

Hold the backtick key (`) while you drag with the Selection tool to change only the pattern tiles. On a US keyboard the key is to the left of **1**.

1. Press **V** to choose the Selection tool, and select an object filled or stroked with a pattern.
2. Press and hold the backtick key.
3. Drag:
   - inside the object to move the tiles;
   - a handle of the bounding box to scale the tiles;
   - from just outside a corner of the bounding box to rotate the tiles. Hold **Shift** as well to rotate in 45° steps.
4. Release the mouse button while you still hold the backtick key, then release the key.

The status bar shows the Selection tool's hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/transform-strokes-corners-and-patterns-pattern-only.webp)

VectorCraft changes only the tiles when the backtick key is still down as you release the mouse button. If you press or release the backtick key part way through a drag, the preview switches at once between moving the tiles and moving the object.

## Square the bounding box again

After you rotate an object, its bounding box stays at the object's angle, and the side handles scale it along its own width and height. To square the bounding box to the page again:

1. Select the rotated objects.
2. Choose **Object → Transform → Reset Bounding Box**. The same command is in the **Transform** submenu of the canvas context menu.

The objects keep their shape and position. VectorCraft also squares the boxes of every object inside the selection, such as the members of groups, compound paths, clipping groups and blends. The command is one undo step, and it does nothing when no box is rotated. It has no default shortcut.

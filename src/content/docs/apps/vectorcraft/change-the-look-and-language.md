This guide covers the settings on the **User Interface** page of Preferences: the brightness and colors of the interface, the canvas color, the interface size, document tabs, tool group labels, iconic panels, the title bar and the interface language. Every setting is listed with its default and range in [Preferences](/apps/vectorcraft/preferences/#user-interface).

## Open the User Interface page

1. On Windows, Linux and the BSDs, choose **Edit → Preferences…** (**Ctrl+K**). On macOS, choose **VectorCraft → Settings → User Interface…**, which opens the dialog on the **User Interface** page. On macOS, **Cmd+K** opens Settings on its **General** page.
2. On Windows, Linux and the BSDs, click **User Interface** in the list of pages.
3. Change the settings, then click **OK**. **Cancel** closes the dialog without changing anything.

## Change the brightness and colors

1. Open the **User Interface** page.
2. Choose a **Brightness**: **Dark**, **Medium Dark** (the default), **Medium Light** or **Light**.
3. Choose a **Color Scheme**:
   - **Modern** (the default) draws the panels in slate grays with the accent color you choose.
   - **Classic** draws the panels in neutral grays with a blue accent. The layout, cards and corners are the same in both schemes.
4. With **Modern**, choose an **Accent Color**: **Coral** (the default), **Blue**, **Violet**, **Green**, **Amber** or **Pink**. The accent color marks controls that are on, chosen or focused, such as a checked box, the selected page in a list and the **OK** button. While **Color Scheme** is **Classic**, **Accent Color** is dimmed.
5. Click **OK**. The window is redrawn in the new brightness and colors.

Brightness is set to Medium Light, Color Scheme Modern, Accent Color Violet and Canvas Color Match User Interface Brightness, and the Language list shows Auto. The window behind is drawn in the light gray Medium Light interface, with the selected page and the OK button in violet](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/change-the-look-and-language-brightness.webp)

Switching workspaces does not change the brightness. On macOS you can also change the brightness from the **Appearance** menu (see [On macOS: the Language and Appearance menus](#on-macos-the-language-and-appearance-menus)).

## Change the canvas color

The canvas color is the color of the area around the artboards.

1. Open the **User Interface** page.
2. Choose a **Canvas Color**:

| Canvas Color | What the area around the artboards shows |
|---|---|
| **Match User Interface Brightness** (the default) | The color that goes with the current **Brightness** |
| **White** | White |
| **Light Gray** | A light gray |
| **Medium Gray** | A medium gray |
| **Dark Gray** | A dark gray |

3. Click **OK**.

**Canvas Color** does not change the color of the artboards or of the artwork.

(cut short) and Color above the tools. The sailboat is selected with blue handles, with the Contextual Task Bar below it](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/change-the-look-and-language-classic.webp)

## Make the interface larger or smaller

**UI Scaling** changes the size of the menus, panels, dialogs, bars and text. It does not change the zoom of the document.

1. Open the **User Interface** page.
2. Under **UI Scaling**, drag the **Scale** slider toward **Smaller** or **Larger**. The scale runs from 0.75 to 2.0 in steps of 0.05, and the default is 1.0. The value shows beside the slider.
3. Turn on **Scale Cursor Proportional to UI** to make the tool cursors grow and shrink with the scale. While it is off (the default), the tool cursors keep their size.
4. Click **OK**.

The Scale slider is at 1.25 and Scale Cursor Proportional to UI is turned on. The menu bar, tools, document tab and dialog are larger than at the default scale](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/change-the-look-and-language-scale.webp)

## Choose how tabs, tools and panels behave

These settings change the document tabs, the Tools panel and panels that are collapsed to icons.

| Setting | Default | On | Off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open Documents As Tabs** | On | Each document you open or create gets a tab in the tab strip. | Each document you open or create afterwards opens in a floating window of its own. |
| **Large Tabs** | Off | The document tabs are taller, with larger titles. | The tabs have the standard height. |
| **Show Tool Group Labels** | Off | The Tools panel shows the name of each group of tools (Select, Shapes, Draw and so on). In a single column, names longer than six characters are cut to their first four characters followed by three dots (**Navi...**). | The tools follow each other with nothing between the groups. |
| **Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels** | Off | A panel you open from a column of panel icons closes again when you press **Esc** or click outside it and its column. | The panel stays open until you click its icon again. |

To put floating documents back into tabs, choose **Window → Arrange → Consolidate All Windows**. You can also turn **Auto-Collapse Iconic Panels** on or off from the menu of a column of panel icons: right-click the grip at the top of the column. For more about tabs, floating windows and panels, see [Customize the workspace](/apps/vectorcraft/customize-the-workspace/).

## Choose the title bar (Windows, Linux and the BSDs)

By default, VectorCraft draws its own title bar on Windows: the menu bar shares a row with the window buttons. On Linux and the BSDs, VectorCraft draws its own title bar where the desktop leaves the frame to the app, and the desktop draws the frame everywhere else. macOS always uses the system title bar, so the page does not show these settings there.

1. Open the **User Interface** page.
2. Turn on **System Title Bar** to use the system's title bar and window buttons.
3. On Linux and the BSDs, turn on **VectorCraft Title Bar on Every Desktop** to draw VectorCraft's own title bar on desktops that would otherwise draw the window frame themselves. While **System Title Bar** is on, this setting is dimmed, and a note says that **System Title Bar** takes precedence.
4. Click **OK**, then quit and start VectorCraft again. VectorCraft reads these settings only when it starts, and the note under them reads "Applies the next time VectorCraft starts."

On Linux and the BSDs, the `VECTORCRAFT_TITLEBAR` environment variable chooses the title bar for one run, whatever the two settings say:

| `VECTORCRAFT_TITLEBAR` | Title bar |
|---|---|
| `app` | VectorCraft draws its own title bar. |
| `system` or `desktop` | The desktop draws the window frame. |

For example, start VectorCraft with `VECTORCRAFT_TITLEBAR=desktop vectorcraft`. While the variable is set, **System Title Bar** and **VectorCraft Title Bar on Every Desktop** are dimmed, and a note says that the variable chooses the title bar. VectorCraft on Windows and macOS does not read the variable.

## Change the interface language

1. Open the **User Interface** page.
2. Under **Language**, open the **Language** list. It starts with **Auto**, then **English**, then the other languages by their own names in alphabetical order. Names in other scripts (Greek, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Georgian, Japanese, Chinese and Korean) follow the Latin ones.
3. Choose a language. The menus, panels and the dialog itself switch to it while the dialog is still open.
4. Click **OK** to keep the language, or **Cancel** to go back to the language you had.

**Auto** (the default) uses the language of your system. When the system language is not one VectorCraft has, **Auto** uses English.

| Languages in the **Language** list |
|---|
| **Auto**, English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bosanski, Català, Čeština, Dansk, Deutsch, Español, Français, Italiano, Magyar, Nederlands, Polski, Português (Brasil), Suomi, Svenska, Tiếng Việt, Türkçe, Ελληνικά, Български, Русский, Українська, हिन्दी, ქართული, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 한국어 |

### Menu and panel order follows the language

The panels in the **Window** menu are listed alphabetically by their names in the interface language. The same goes for the **Window → Type** submenu and for **Window → Brush Libraries**, **Graphic Style Libraries**, **Swatch Libraries** and **Symbol Libraries**. Accented letters sort with their plain letters, so in Polish **Łącza** (Links) sorts under L. When you change the language, the order changes with it.

![VectorCraft in German with the Fenster (Window) menu open over a night market street at dusk. Neues Fenster, Anordnen and Arbeitsbereich are at the top, followed by Steuerung, Hilfeleiste, Kontextbezogene Taskleiste, Werkzeuge and Werkzeugleisten, then the panels in German alphabetical order from 3D und Materialien, Aktionen and Angleichen down to Musteroptionen](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/change-the-look-and-language-language.webp)

The interface language does not change the language of the text in your documents. To set the language used for spelling and hyphenation, and to set type in other scripts, see [Set type for other languages](/apps/vectorcraft/set-type-for-other-languages/).

## On macOS: the Language and Appearance menus

On macOS, the **VectorCraft** app menu has two submenus after **Settings**:

- **Language** lists **Automatic**, then every interface language by its own name, in the same order as the **Language** list in Preferences. The current choice has a check mark. Choosing a language changes the interface language at once, the same as choosing it in Preferences and clicking **OK**.
- **Appearance** lists the four brightness levels: **Dark**, **Medium Dark**, **Medium Light** and **Light**. Choosing one changes the **Brightness** setting.

Windows, Linux and the BSDs have no menu for these settings. Use the **User Interface** page of Preferences there.

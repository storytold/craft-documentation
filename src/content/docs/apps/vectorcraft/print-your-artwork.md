This guide covers the Print dialog. It shows how to choose which artboards print and on what paper, add printer's marks and bleed, set the graphics, color management and advanced options, scale or tile art that is larger than the paper, and save, manage and share the settings as presets for the next job.

## Open the Print dialog

1. Open the document you want to print.
2. Choose **File → Print…** (**Ctrl+P**, or **Cmd+P** on macOS).
3. Pick a section in the section list: **General**, **Marks and Bleed**, **Output**, **Graphics**, **Color Management**, **Advanced** or **Summary**.
4. Check the preview under the section list. It shows each page as it prints. Use the arrows under the preview to step through the pages.
5. Press **Print** to print, or **Done** to keep the settings with the document without printing.

VectorCraft saves the print settings with the document, and the dialog opens with the same choices next time.

## Choose what prints

The **General** section sets the printer, the paper and which artboards print.

1. Under **Print Preset**, keep **[Default]** or pick a preset you saved.
2. Under **Printer**, pick a printer. **PDF File** writes a print-ready PDF instead of sending the job to a printer. **Setup…** opens the system's settings for the chosen printer.
3. Set **Copies**. With more than one copy, **Collate** prints whole sets in order. **Reverse Order** prints the last page first.
4. Under **Artboards**, choose **All**, or choose **Range** and type the artboard numbers, for example `1-3, 5`. **Ignore Artboards (all the art as one page)** prints everything in the document on one page. **Skip Blank Artboards** leaves out artboards with no art that prints. When every artboard you chose is blank, nothing prints and **Summary** reports the error.
5. Under **Media**, choose a paper **Size**. **Custom** lets you type a width and height.
6. Under **Orientation**, leave **Auto-Rotate** on to turn the paper to match each artboard, or turn it off and pick an orientation. Turn on **Transverse** to turn the page a quarter turn on the paper, for roll-fed printers.
7. Under **Options**, choose which layers print with **Print Layers**, where the art is placed on the paper with **Placement**, and how it is sized with **Scaling**.
8. To move the art on the paper, drag it in the preview. When you release the mouse button, the dialog stores the new position as the **Placement** X and Y offset. Dragging does not move the art while a tiling choice is on.

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Copies** | 1 to 999 | 1 |
| **Collate** | On, off | On |
| **Reverse Order** | On, off | Off |
| **Artboards** | All, Range, Ignore Artboards | All |
| **Skip Blank Artboards** | On, off | Off |
| **Size** (Media) | Letter, Legal, Tabloid, A3 to A6, B4 and B5 (ISO), B4 to B6 (JIS), Japanese paper and envelope sizes, Custom | Letter |
| **Auto-Rotate** | On, off | On |
| **Transverse** | On, off | Off |
| **Print Layers** | Visible & Printable Layers, Visible Layers, All Layers | Visible & Printable Layers |
| **Placement** | Any of nine reference points, plus an X and Y offset | Center |
| **Scaling** | Do Not Scale, Fit to Page, Custom Scale, Tile Full Pages, Tile Imageable Areas | Do Not Scale |
| **Copies per Sheet (as many as fit, in a grid)** | On, off. Not available with a tiling choice | Off |
| **Gutter** | The space between copies on a sheet, from 0 to 720 pt | 0 pt |

**Placement** is grayed out while a tiling choice is on, and after you place the pages with the **Print Tiling Tool**. After the tool places them, the General section shows the note "The Print Tiling tool placed the pages." Unless a tiling choice is on, dragging in the preview then moves where the pages start. **Reset** next to the note discards the tool's position, and **Placement** is available again when **Scaling** is not a tiling choice.

:::note
Template layers never print, whatever **Print Layers** is set to. A layer with **Print** turned off in its Layer Options is left out by **Visible & Printable Layers**.
:::

## Choose a printer

Pick a printer under **Printer**. **PDF File** saves the job as a PDF instead, so you can print it later or check exactly what would print.

**Setup…** opens your system's printer settings: the printer's own settings on Windows, **Print & Scan** on macOS, and `system-config-printer` or the CUPS web page on Linux. VectorCraft doesn't read changes made there, so choose the paper in the Print dialog.

VectorCraft sends the whole job to your system as one PDF. In the web version, printing goes through the browser's print dialog.

:::note
If your system can't print, **Print** saves the job as a PDF and tells you in the status bar.
:::

## Add printer's marks and bleed

1. Open the **Marks and Bleed** section.
2. Turn on **All printer's marks**, or pick them one at a time: **Trim marks**, **Registration marks**, **Color bars** and **Page information**.
3. Choose a **Printer mark type** (Roman or Japanese), a **Trim mark weight** (0.125 pt, 0.25 pt or 0.5 pt) and an **Offset** from the artboard edge. The defaults are Roman, 0.25 pt and 6 pt.
4. Under **Bleeds**, leave **Use document bleed settings** on to print the bleed set for the document, or turn it off and type **Top**, **Bottom**, **Left** and **Right** values.

:::caution
The printed area is the artboard together with its bleed and marks. When that area is larger than the printable area of the paper, **Summary** shows a warning. Choose larger paper, or set **Scaling** to **Fit to Page** to size the art so it fits with its marks.
:::

## Print separations

The **Output** section chooses between one color page and one page per ink.

1. Set **Mode** to **Composite** to print in color, or to **Separations** to print one gray page for each ink that prints.
2. Set **Emulsion** to **Up (right reading)** or **Down (right reading)**. Down mirrors the page.
3. Set **Image** to **Positive** or **Negative**.
4. With separations, turn on **Convert All Spot Colors to Process** to print spot colors on the process inks instead of their own pages.
5. With separations, the **Document Ink Options** list shows each ink. Turn single inks on or off and set their frequency and angle.

[Print color separations](/apps/vectorcraft/print-color-separations/) shows how to get the inks ready, check each plate and choose a press profile.

## Set graphics options

Most jobs print fine with the default graphics, color and advanced settings. Change them when a printer has trouble or colors look wrong.

The **Graphics** section holds the curve **Flatness** and font **Download** settings.

1. Open the **Graphics** section.
2. Under **Paths**, leave **Automatic flatness** on to let the printer choose how finely it draws curves. You can turn **Automatic flatness** off and type a **Flatness** value from 0.2 (best quality) to 100 (fastest printing), and VectorCraft saves the value with the print settings. In this version the printer still chooses the flatness, and **Summary** shows a warning.
3. Under **Fonts**, choose a **Download** setting. VectorCraft saves the choice with the print settings and presets. In this version the choice does not change the printed output.

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Automatic flatness** | On, off | On |
| **Flatness** | 0.2 to 100 | 1 |
| **Download** | None, Subset, Complete | Subset |

## Manage color when printing

The **Color Management** section sets how VectorCraft converts colors for the printer.

1. Open the **Color Management** section.
2. Under **Printer profile**, keep **Same As Source** to print the colors as they are, or pick the printer's RGB or CMYK profile. In **Composite** mode, the colors are converted to that profile. In **Separations** mode, a CMYK profile is used to separate the colors, and an RGB profile is left out with a warning.
3. Under **Rendering intent**, choose how colors that the printer cannot reproduce are converted.
4. Leave **Preserve CMYK Numbers** on to print CMYK colors with their own values. Turn it off to convert CMYK colors with the color settings too.

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Printer profile** | Same As Source, sRGB IEC61966-2.1, Wide Gamut RGB (1998 primaries), Display P3, ProPhoto RGB, VectorCraft Generic CMYK (SWOP-like), Device CMYK (uncalibrated), and any profiles you loaded | Same As Source |
| **Rendering intent** | Perceptual, Relative Colorimetric, Saturation, Absolute Colorimetric | Relative Colorimetric |
| **Preserve CMYK Numbers** | On, off | On |

![The Print dialog on its Color Management section, with Printer profile set to Same As Source, Rendering intent set to Relative Colorimetric and Preserve CMYK Numbers turned on.

[Manage color and proof for print](/apps/vectorcraft/manage-color-and-proof/) covers color settings, profiles and soft-proofing.

## Set advanced options

The **Advanced** section sets the printer's margin, bitmap printing, overprints and transparency flattening.

1. Open the **Advanced** section.
2. Under **Printer**, type the **Unprintable margin**: the edge of the paper that the printer cannot reach. VectorCraft places the art inside it, and the preview shows the margin as a dashed line.
3. Turn on **Print as Bitmap** to print each page as one image at the document's raster effects resolution. This option is available in **Composite** mode only.
4. Under **Overprint and Transparency Flattener Options**, choose what happens to overprinting fills and strokes with **Overprints**. This option is available in **Composite** mode only. Separations always keep overprints.
5. Under **Preset**, keep **None (keep transparency)** to print transparency as it is, or pick a flattener preset to flatten transparency before printing.

| Option | Choices | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Unprintable margin** | 0 to 144 pt | 0 pt |
| **Print as Bitmap** | On, off | Off |
| **Overprints** | Preserve, Discard (overprinting objects knock out), Simulate (prints them as Overprint Preview shows them) | Preserve |
| **Preset** | None (keep transparency), High Resolution, Medium Resolution, Low Resolution, and your saved flattener presets | None (keep transparency) |

![The Print dialog on its Advanced section at the default settings: Unprintable margin 0 pt, Print as Bitmap turned off, Overprints set to Preserve and Preset set to None (keep transparency). The preview shows the night market poster on a letter page](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/print-advanced.webp)

## Scale or tile large art

When the art is larger than the paper, scale it down or split it across several sheets.

1. In the **General** section, open **Scaling** and pick a choice from the following table.
2. For **Custom Scale**, type the width and height percentages under **Scale**.

| Choice | What prints |
|---|---|
| **Do Not Scale** | The art at 100% |
| **Fit to Page** | The art as large as fits the printable area with its marks, keeping its proportions |
| **Custom Scale** | The art at the width and height percentages you type |
| **Tile Full Pages** | Pages the size of the paper, overlapping by the **Overlap** value |
| **Tile Imageable Areas** | Pages the size of the printable area of the paper |

[Print a large poster](/apps/vectorcraft/print-tiling/) covers the two tiling choices step by step: the **Overlap** and **Tile Range** settings, how the tiles are numbered, **View → Show Print Tiling** and the **Print Tiling Tool**.

![A wide night market banner split across three page outlines while a drag with the Print Tiling Tool is in progress. The crosshair pointer sits at the top-left corner of the first page, just above and to the left of the artboard, and a readout beside it shows dX -32 pt and dY -10 pt](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/print-tiling-drag.webp)

When you drag with the **Print Tiling Tool**, the pointer sets the top-left corner of the first page's printable area and snaps to the artboard's edges. Double-clicking the tool's button in the toolbar discards that position, as **Reset** does.

## Save print presets

A print preset stores the Print dialog's settings, except the printer, under a name. VectorCraft keeps your presets with its preferences, so you can use them in every document. Resetting the preferences does not remove them.

### Save the settings from the Print dialog

1. Choose **File → Print…** and set up the job.
2. In the Print dialog, press **Save Preset…** next to **Print Preset**. A **Save as preset** row appears with a suggested name such as "Print Preset 1".
3. Type a name and press **Save**. The **Print Preset** list now shows the new preset.

If you type the name of a saved preset, the new settings replace that preset's settings. You cannot save a preset under the name [Default].

After you pick a preset and change a setting, the **Print Preset** list shows **[Custom]**. Pick the preset again to restore its settings.

### Manage presets

To manage presets without opening the Print dialog, use **Edit → Print Presets…**.

1. Choose **Edit → Print Presets…**.
2. Select a preset in the **Presets** list. **[Default]** comes first, followed by your saved presets.
3. Check the **Differences from [Default]** list next to the **Presets** list. Each row names a section, an option and the preset's value, for example "General › Media: tabloid". For [Default] the list reads "None."
4. Press one of the buttons under the list, described in the following table.
5. Press **Close** when you are done.

![The Print Presets dialog with [Default], Night Market Tabloid and Proof Letter in the Presets list and Night Market Tabloid selected. Next to the list, Differences from [Default] shows Media set to tabloid, a bleed of 9.0 on every side with Use Document off, and Color Bars, Page Info, Registration and Trim marks on, with the New…, Edit…, Delete, Import… and Export… buttons under the list](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/print-your-artwork-print-presets.webp)

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New…** | Starts a new preset from the selected one, and opens a copy of its settings in the **New Print Preset** editor |
| **Edit…** | Changes a saved preset, and opens it in the **Edit Print Preset** editor |
| **Delete** | Removes a saved preset and selects the preset above it |
| **Import…** | Loads presets from a `.vcprintpresets` file and selects the first one it adds |
| **Export…** | Saves the selected preset to a `.vcprintpresets` file |

[Default] cannot be edited or deleted. **Edit…** and **Delete** are unavailable while it is selected. Press **New…** to start an editable copy.

### Make or change a preset in the editor

1. In **Edit → Print Presets…**, select the preset to start from and press **New…**, or select a saved preset and press **Edit…**.
2. Type a name in **Preset name**. A new preset starts with the first free name, such as "Print Preset 2". When you edit a saved preset, a new name renames it.
3. Set the options. The editor has the same sections and preview as the Print dialog, from **General** to **Summary**, without the **Print Preset** and **Printer** rows.
4. Press **Save Preset**. The Print Presets dialog opens again with the preset selected.

You cannot give a new preset the name of a preset that exists, and you cannot rename a saved preset to the name of another preset. In both cases VectorCraft does not save the preset and reports that a preset with that name exists.

### Share presets as files

A `.vcprintpresets` file holds print presets as text, so you can use the same presets on another computer.

1. In **Edit → Print Presets…**, select a preset and press **Export…**. You can export [Default] too.
2. Choose a folder and a file name, and save the file.
3. On the other computer, choose **Edit → Print Presets…**, press **Import…** and pick the file. You can also open the file with **File → Open…** or drop it on the VectorCraft window. VectorCraft then adds its presets instead of opening a document, and the status bar lists them after "Imported print presets:".

When an imported preset has the name of a saved one, VectorCraft adds a number to the name: "Night Market Tabloid 2", then "Night Market Tabloid 3". A [Default] preset in the file is added as a saved preset named "Default 2", then "Default 3" and so on, and the built-in [Default] does not change.

:::note
VectorCraft does not import a file that is not a print presets file, a file with settings that the Print dialog does not accept, or a file with more than 1000 presets.
:::

## Check before you print

1. Choose **View → Overprint Preview** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Y**, or **Cmd+Option+Shift+Y** on macOS) to see how overprinting fills and strokes will print.
2. Choose **Window → Separations Preview** to show or hide each ink plate. Alt-click (Option-click on macOS) a plate's eye to show only that plate.
3. In the Print dialog, open **Summary**. It lists the page count, every option you changed from the default, and warnings such as art larger than the printable area, type that prints in a fallback font, or type that does not fit its frame.

:::tip
For a print shop, choose **File → Save as PDF…** instead. Its dialog has the same marks and bleed settings, and the shop prints the PDF on its own equipment.
:::

## Print from the web version

The web version of VectorCraft prints through the browser.

1. Choose **File → Print…** and set up the job as in the desktop app.
2. Under **Printer**, keep **Default Printer**. The browser does not list its printers to VectorCraft, and **Setup…** is unavailable.
3. Press **Print**. VectorCraft prepares the job as a PDF and opens the browser's print dialog, and the status bar shows "Printing “*document name*”: pick the printer in the browser's print dialog."
4. Pick the printer in the browser's print dialog and print.

To keep the job as a file instead, choose **PDF File** under **Printer**. The browser downloads the PDF.

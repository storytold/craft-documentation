This guide covers the images in a document after you place them: the Links panel, relinking and embedding, missing links when a document opens, editing an image in its own app, cropping and masking, rasterizing, and turning an image into tiles or halftone dots. To bring an image into a document, see [Open and save files](/apps/vectorcraft/open-and-save-files/).

## See every image in the Links panel

1. Choose **Window → Links**. Each row shows a thumbnail, the file name and a status badge.
2. Click a row to select its image on the canvas. **Ctrl**-click (**Cmd**-click on macOS) adds or removes a row, and **Shift**-click selects every row from the last row you clicked without Shift to this one. Hold **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) as well to add that range to the selection.
3. Double-click a row to select its image and scroll the view to it.

| Badge | Status | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Red circle with **?** | Missing | VectorCraft cannot find the file. The image shows the preview saved with the document. |
| Amber triangle with **!** | Modified | The file changed after VectorCraft last read it. |
| Image icon | Embedded | The pixels are stored in the document, and there is no file. |
| No badge | Linked | VectorCraft found the file, and it has not changed. |

VectorCraft checks the linked files every 2 seconds. If you move or edit a file in another app while the document is open, its row shows the new status. Hold the pointer over a row to see the file's path.

The **Link Info** section under the list shows the first selected image's name, format, color space, folder, PPI, effective PPI at its placed size, pixel dimensions, scale, rotation, file size, dates and status. Click the chevron at the bottom left of the panel, or choose **Show Link Info** in the panel menu, to hide or show it.

The panel menu, opened from the menu button at the top right of the panel, also holds these options:

- **Select Linked**, **Select Embedded**, **Select Missing** and **Select Modified** select every image with that status in the document. Hold **Shift** while you choose one to add to the selection.
- **Show All**, **Show Missing**, **Show Modified** and **Show Embedded** filter the list.
- **Sort by Name**, **Sort by Kind** and **Sort by Status** sort it. With no sort chosen, the list follows the stacking order, top first.
- **No Thumbnails**, **Small Thumbnails**, **Medium Thumbnails** and **Large Thumbnails** set the thumbnail size. Medium is the default.

The menu lists Relink…, Relink to Folder…, Find in Folder…, Go To Link, Update Link, Edit Original, Embed Image(s), Unembed…, Placement Options… and Show in Folder, then the Select, Show, Sort and thumbnail options, with Show All, Medium Thumbnails and Show Link Info checked](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/links-panel-menu.webp)

## Relink, update and embed images

Select one or more rows in the Links panel, then choose a command from the panel menu. Relink…, Go To Link, Update Link, Edit Original and Break Link are also buttons at the bottom of the panel.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Relink…** | Links the selected images to a file you pick. An embedded image becomes linked. With the default **Placement Options**, each image keeps its bounds. |
| **Relink to Folder…** | Links each selected image to the file with the same name in a folder you pick. With nothing selected, it relinks every missing image. The status bar lists the names it did not find. |
| **Find in Folder…** | Searches a folder and its subfolders for the selected linked files, or for the missing ones when none is selected. See [Fix missing links when a document opens](#fix-missing-links-when-a-document-opens). |
| **Go To Link** | Selects the image and scrolls the view to it. It needs one selected row. |
| **Update Link** | Reads a modified file again. With the default **Placement Options**, each image keeps its bounds. |
| **Edit Original** | Opens the linked file in its own app. See [Edit an image in its own app](#edit-an-image-in-its-own-app). |
| **Embed Image(s)** | Stores the pixels of the selected linked images in the document and drops the link. The **Break Link** button does the same. A missing image stays linked until you relink it. |
| **Unembed…** | Writes one embedded image to a file you name and links the image to that file. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP images keep their format, and other images are written as PNG. |
| **Placement Options…** | Sets how a new or updated file takes the image's place. |
| **Show in Folder** | Shows the linked file in the system's file manager. |

Each relink, update, embed and unembed is one undo step.

**Placement Options…** has these settings. They apply the next time the image is relinked or updated.

| Setting | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Preserve** | **Transforms** keeps the image's scale, rotation and position. **Bounds** stretches the new file into the old bounds, and it is the default. **File Dimensions** places it at 100% without rotation. **Bounds (Fit Proportionally)** and **Bounds (Fill Proportionally)** scale it to fit inside or to cover the old bounds. |
| **Alignment** | Where the new art sits inside the old bounds. It does not apply to Bounds. |
| **Clip to Bounding Box** | Clips a larger file to the old bounds. |

The selected lantern-street.png image shows its Linked File section in the Properties panel](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/placement-options.webp)

When one image is selected, the Properties panel and the Control bar show a **Linked File** or **Embedded Image** section. It has **Embed** and **Edit Original** for a linked image, or **Unembed…** for an embedded one, and **Replace…**, which swaps in another file that keeps its own aspect ratio inside the old bounds. On the Control bar, click the file name for **Replace…**, **Go To Link**, **Edit Original**, **Update Link** and **Placement Options…**.

## Fix missing links when a document opens

VectorCraft looks for each linked file at the path saved in the document, then at the same relative path from the document's folder, then by name in the document's folder. When a file is still missing, the **Linked File Not Found** dialog opens and asks about one file at a time.

1. Read the file name and the path where VectorCraft looked.
2. Choose what to do with it:
   - **Replace…** relinks the image to a file you pick.
   - **Ignore** leaves the image linked. It keeps showing the preview saved with the document.
   - **Find in Folder…** opens **Find Linked Files** and searches a folder you pick, with its subfolders, for every missing file.
   - **Cancel** closes the dialog and leaves this file and the other missing files linked as they are. Their images keep showing the saved preview.
3. When more files are missing, the dialog shows **Apply to All**. With it on, **Replace…** looks for the other missing files by name in the folder of the file you picked, and **Ignore** ignores all of them. VectorCraft asks again about any file it does not find.

![The Linked File Not Found dialog over the dusk-bay-postcard document, naming lantern-street.png and the path where VectorCraft looked for it, with Find in Folder…, Ignore, Cancel and Replace…. The lantern-street.png row in the Links panel has a red missing badge](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/linked-file-not-found.webp)

In **Find Linked Files**, each missing file lists the files found with its name, best match first. A match marked **Same file** has the size and contents saved with the link, and **Same size** has the size only. Choose a match for each file, or **Don't Relink**, and press **Relink**. VectorCraft chooses a match for you only when it finds a single file with that name, or a single match marked **Same file**. Press **Stop** to end a long search. When you open **Find Linked Files** from **Linked File Not Found**, VectorCraft asks again in **Linked File Not Found** about each file you leave at **Don't Relink** and each file that fails to relink. For a saved document, turn on **Copy into the document's folder** to copy each image's file next to the document before relinking. VectorCraft never replaces a file that is already there.

![The Find Linked Files dialog for lantern-street.png. It lists two files with that name, the one in the archive folder marked Same file and chosen, then the one in the drafts folder, then Don't Relink. Below the list, the dialog reports 5 folders and 5 files searched, and Copy into the document's folder is off](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/find-linked-files.webp)

After the missing files, VectorCraft offers to update the linked files that changed since the document was saved. **Update Links** in **Edit → Preferences… → File Handling** on Windows and Linux, and in **VectorCraft → Settings → File Handling…** on macOS, sets what happens to a changed file:

| Update Links | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Ask When Modified** | VectorCraft asks before it shows the new version. This is the default. |
| **Automatically** | VectorCraft reads the changed file and updates the image. |
| **Manually** | The status bar reports the change, and the image keeps the old version until you choose **Update Link**. |

The same setting applies to files that another app changes while the document is open.

![The File Handling page of Preferences over the dusk-bay-postcard document, with Update Links set to Ask When Modified under Files](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/update-links-preference.webp)

## Edit an image in its own app

1. Select a linked image.
2. Choose **Edit → Edit Original**, or click **Edit Original** in the Links panel, the Properties panel or the Control bar.
3. Edit and save the file in the app that opens.
4. Return to VectorCraft. The Links panel marks the image as modified. VectorCraft then updates the image, asks you first, or waits for **Update Link**, as **Update Links** in Preferences is set.

![The dusk-bay-postcard document with the hill-view.png image selected and an amber modified badge on its row in the Links panel. The Update Modified Links dialog says that 1 linked image changed on disk and asks whether to show the new version, with Cancel and OK](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/update-modified-links.webp)

Edit Original opens the file in the app your system uses for its file type. It opens only image and document files in formats VectorCraft reads. A placed VectorCraft document opens in a new tab in VectorCraft instead, and saving it there updates the placed copy (see [Edit the placed document](/apps/vectorcraft/place-linked-documents/#edit-the-placed-document)). An embedded image has no file to open, and a missing file must be relinked first.

## Crop an image

1. Select the image.
2. Choose **Object → Crop Image**, or click **Crop Image** in the Properties panel's Quick Actions, on the Control bar or on the Contextual Task Bar. A crop box appears over the part of the image that sits on its artboard, or over the whole image when it lies inside the artboard.
3. Drag a handle to move an edge or corner, or drag inside the box to move it. The box stays inside the image, and the part outside it is dimmed. A readout next to the pointer shows the box's width and height.
4. To type the size, enter **X** and **Y** (the box's center), **W** and **H** on the Control bar.
5. Press **Enter** or click **Apply** to crop the image. Press **Esc** or click **Cancel** to leave it as it was. Both return to the Selection tool.

The crop box's right edge is dragged left to just past the sailboat, between the boat and the sun's reflection, the part of the image outside the box is dimmed, and a readout beside the dragged right edge shows W 698.54 px and H 620.00 px. The Control bar shows the box's X, Y, W and H fields with Apply and Cancel](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/crop-image.webp)

## Mask an image instead of cropping it

**Crop Image** removes the pixels outside the crop box from the image. **Mask** hides them behind a clipping path and keeps the whole image.

1. Select the image.
2. Click **Mask** in the Properties panel's Quick Actions, or on the Control bar next to **Crop Image**. VectorCraft puts the image in a clip group with a rectangle on the image's outline, rotated with the image, and selects that rectangle. This is one undo step.
3. With the Selection tool, drag a handle of the rectangle. The part of the image outside the rectangle is hidden, and a readout next to the pointer shows the rectangle's width and height. The image itself keeps its size.

![The dusk-bay-postcard document after Mask on the harbor image, with the Selection tool dragging the clipping path's right edge handle to the left so the harbor is hidden right of the sailboat and a readout shows W 712.00 px and H 620.00 px. The Properties panel shows the selected Path at W 712 px and H 620 px, and the status bar shows the Selection tool hints](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/work-with-placed-images-mask.webp)

To change the hidden part later, select the clip group and choose **Object → Clipping Mask → Edit Clipping Path**, then drag the rectangle's handles again.

To remove the mask, click the image with the Selection tool to select the clip group, then choose **Object → Clipping Mask → Release** (**Ctrl+Alt+7**, or **Cmd+Option+7** on macOS), or right-click and choose **Release Clipping Mask**. The whole image shows again. The rectangle stays in the group, with no fill or stroke unless you painted it after you made the mask. With only the rectangle selected, Release leaves the clip group as it is. [Combine and cut shapes](/apps/vectorcraft/combine-and-cut-shapes/#clip-art-with-a-clipping-mask) covers the other clipping mask commands.

## Rasterize vector art

**Object → Rasterize…** turns the selected objects into one embedded image, in one undo step.

1. Select the objects.
2. Choose **Object → Rasterize…**.
3. Set the options, and click **OK**.

The dialog starts from the document's raster effects settings, which you set in **Effect → Document Raster Effects Settings…**.

| Option | What it sets |
|---|---|
| **Add Around** | Room around the art, from 0 to 1000 pt |
| **Anti Alias** | `none` for hard edges, `art` to smooth the art, or `type` to snap text to pixels |
| **Background** | `transparent`, `white`, `black` or a color as `#rrggbb` |
| **Clipping Mask** | Puts the image in a clip group with the art's outline |
| **Color Model** | RGB (CMYK in a CMYK document), Grayscale or Bitmap |
| **Ppi** | The resolution, from 1 to 2400 ppi; a new document starts at 72 |

![The Rasterize dialog over the dusk-bay-postcard document, with the title Greetings from Dusk Bay selected. Add Around is 0, Anti Alias is type, Background is transparent, Clipping Mask is off, Color Model is RGB and Ppi is 300](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/rasterize-dialog.webp)

## Turn an image into tiles or dots

**Object → Create Object Mosaic…** turns an image into a grid of colored rectangles.

1. Select an image.
2. Choose **Object → Create Object Mosaic…**.
3. Set the grid and click **OK**.

| Option | What it sets | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Columns** and **Rows** | The number of tiles across and down, from 1 to 1000 | 10 by 10 |
| **Spacing X** and **Spacing Y** | The gap between tiles in points | 0 |
| **Gray** | Fills the tiles with grays instead of colors | Off |
| **Delete Raster** | Removes the image after the tiles are made | Off |

Each tile takes the average color of its part of the image. The tiles come in a group named Object Mosaic.

![The Create Object Mosaic dialog over the hill-view image, with Columns 40, Rows 30, Spacing X 1 and Spacing Y 1, and Gray and Delete Raster off](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/object-mosaic.webp)

![The dusk-bay-postcard document at 180% after Create Object Mosaic with the settings above.

The Layers panel shows the Object Mosaic group above hill-view.png in the Photos layer, and the Links panel still lists hill-view.png](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/object-mosaic-result.webp)

**Object → Vector Halftone…** redraws the selected objects (vectors, type or images) as vector dots sized by their tone. The canvas previews the result while the dialog is open.

| Option | What it sets | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | Circle, Ellipse, Square, Diamond or Line | Circle |
| **Frequency** | The screen ruling, from 1 to 150 lines per inch | 20 lpi |
| **Angle** | The screen angle, from −90° to 90° | 45° |
| **Screens** | **Mono** draws one screen in one color. **CMYK** draws four screens that multiply, with cyan at −30°, magenta at +30° and yellow at −45° from the angle. | Mono |
| **Color** | The dot color for a Mono screen | `#000000` |
| **Invert** | Puts the dots in the light tones | Off |
| **Clip to Art** | Clips the dots to the art's outline | On |
| **Keep Original** | Keeps the original art as well as the dots | Off |
| **Preview** | Turns the live preview on the canvas on or off | On |

The result is one group with one path for each screen, made in one undo step.

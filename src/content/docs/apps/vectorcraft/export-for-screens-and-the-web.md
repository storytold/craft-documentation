summary: Export artboards and assets at several sizes and formats in one pass.
parent: workflows
---

This page shows how to export every artboard of a document at several scales and formats at once, how to collect pieces of art as assets and export them on their own, and how to write single SVG and PNG files. It also covers the options of each export format, the pixel tools for small screen art and the Save for Web (Legacy) dialog.

## Choose an export command

All of these commands are in the **File** menu.

| Command | What it writes | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **Export → Export for Screens…** | Every chosen artboard or asset, in every format row, in one pass | Icon sets, app assets and web images at 1x, 2x and other sizes |
| **Export → Export As…** | One file in the format you pick, or one file per artboard | A single SVG, PNG, PDF or other file |
| **Export → Export As SVG…** | An SVG file, with the SVG Options dialog | SVG files for the web |
| **Export → Export As PNG…** | A PNG file, with the PNG Options dialog | A single PNG image |
| **Export → Save for Web (Legacy)…** | One optimized GIF, JPEG, PNG-8 or PNG-24 image, previewed beside the original | Comparing file sizes before you save |
| **Export Selection…** | The selected objects, collected as an asset and opened on the Assets tab of Export for Screens | One icon or element out of a larger design |

## Export artboards with Export for Screens

1. Give each artboard the name you want its files to have. Export for Screens names each file after its artboard.
2. Choose **File → Export → Export for Screens…** (**Ctrl+Alt+E**, or **Cmd+Option+E** on macOS). The dialog opens on the settings the document last exported with. If the Artboard tool is active, the dialog checks the artboards you selected with that tool.
3. On the **Artboards** tab, check the artboards to export. **Grid View** and **List View** change how the thumbnails are shown, and **Clear Selection** unchecks them all.
4. Under **Select**, choose **All**, **Range** (for example `1-3`), or **Full Document**. Full Document writes one file per format row for the whole document: a PDF row writes every artboard, and the other rows write the bounds of all visible art.
5. Turn on **Include Bleed** to grow each artboard by the document's bleed. **Include Artboard Fill** draws each artboard's background color behind its art. It is on by default.
6. Under **Export to**, choose a folder. **Open Location after Export** shows the files in your file manager when the export finishes. **Create Sub-folders** puts each row's files in a sub-folder named by **Scale** (for example `2x`) or by **Format** (for example `SVG`).
7. Under **Formats**, set each row's **Scale**, **Suffix** and **Format**. **+ Add Scale** adds a PNG row at the next whole factor above the largest factor so far, and the **Remove** button at the end of a row deletes it.
8. Type a **Prefix** to put the same text in front of every file name.
9. Check the line under the lists, which shows how many items are selected and how many files the export will write.
10. Choose **Export Artboard**. On the Assets tab the button reads **Export Asset**.

![The Export for Screens dialog with three artboards named Icon, Badge and Splash selected, format rows for PNG at 1x, PNG at 2x with the @2x suffix and SVG, and a line saying how many files the export will write](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/export-for-screens.webp)

In the web version of VectorCraft, the **Export to** area reads "Your browser downloads the files (several as one .zip)." and the button reads **Download**. An export of one file downloads that file, and an export of several files downloads them as one `.zip` file.

### Scales, suffixes and file names

A raster row's **Scale** can be a factor or a target size:

| Scale | What the row writes | Default suffix |
|---|---|---|
| `1x` | The artboard at its own size | None |
| `2x`, `3x` | The artboard at two or three times its size | `@2x`, `@3x` |
| `100w` | An image 100 pixels wide | `@100w` |
| `100h` | An image 100 pixels high | `@100h` |
| `72ppi` | An image at 72 pixels per inch | None |

The **Scale** list offers `0.5x`, `0.75x`, `1x`, `1.5x`, `2x`, `3x`, `4x`, `512w`, `512h`, `72ppi`, `150ppi` and `300ppi`, and you can type any other value. While a row's suffix is the default one, it changes with the scale. The Scale field is unavailable on SVG, PDF, EPS, AI and VectorCraft rows.

With these settings, an artboard named Icon and a 2x PNG row with sub-folders by scale gives the file `2x/Icon@2x.png`. Vector rows (SVG, PDF, EPS) leave out size suffixes. When two artboards have the same name, the files of the second and later ones end in `-2`, `-3` and so on. An unnamed artboard is written as `Artboard-N`, where N is its number.

:::tip
The two platform buttons above the format rows replace the rows with a ready set and turn on sub-folders by scale. One set writes PNG at 1x, 2x and 3x. The other writes PNG at screen densities from 0.75x to 4x, each in its own density sub-folder.
:::

The **Format Settings** button (the gear) sets the options that apply to every row of one format, such as the JPEG method or SVG styling. The **Format Presets** menu saves the current rows and settings as a preset with **Save Preset…** and removes one with **Delete Preset**. When you export artboards with a PDF row, **Export PDFs As** chooses **Single File** (every artboard as a page of one PDF) or **Multiple Files**.

The **Format** list offers these choices:

| Group | Formats |
|---|---|
| Raster | PNG, PNG 8, JPG 100, JPG 80, JPG 50, WebP, GIF, TIFF |
| Vector and documents | SVG, PDF, PDF Print, EPS, AI, VectorCraft |

A **PDF Print** row adds trim marks, registration targets, color bars and page information. When you choose PDF Print for a row with an empty suffix, VectorCraft sets the suffix to `-print`. EPS, AI and VectorCraft rows write a document that holds the item alone, on its one artboard.

:::caution
WebP rows write lossless WebP files. Lossy WebP is not available.
:::

### Set the options for every row of a format

1. In Export for Screens, choose the **Format Settings** button (the gear) at the right end of the **Formats** line. The right side of the dialog shows the options of the first row's format.
2. Choose another format from the **Format** list if needed: **PNG**, **PNG 8**, **JPG**, **WebP**, **GIF**, **TIFF**, **SVG** or **PDF**.
3. Set the options. They apply to every row of that format.
4. Choose **Done** to go back to the format rows.

The raster formats show the same options as their Export As dialogs (see [Set the options for each format](#set-the-options-for-each-format)), without the JPEG quality, which each JPG row sets, and without the image map. SVG shows the SVG options. PDF shows a **PDF Preset** list with **VectorCraft Default** and the PDF presets you saved.

### Export PDFs as one file or several

**Export PDFs As** is available on the Artboards tab when at least one row writes PDF and **Select** is not set to Full Document. **Multiple Files** (the default) writes one PDF per artboard. **Single File** writes one PDF for each PDF row, with every chosen artboard as a page, and the counter under the lists counts that PDF as one file.

## Save and reuse format presets

A format preset keeps the format rows, their Format Settings, the prefix, the sub-folder choice, Include Bleed and Include Artboard Fill. It does not keep which artboards or assets are checked. Presets are stored with your preferences, so every document can use them.

1. In Export for Screens, set up the format rows and their settings.
2. Choose the **Format Presets** button (☰) beside the platform buttons, then **Save Preset…**.
3. Type a name in the **Name** field and choose **Save**. **Cancel** closes the field without saving. Saving under the name of a preset you saved before replaces it.
4. To use a preset, open the **Format Presets** menu and choose its name. The dialog takes the preset's rows, settings, prefix, sub-folders and bleed and fill choices.
5. To remove a saved preset, apply it, then choose **Delete Preset** in the same menu.

VectorCraft has two built-in presets, which you can apply but not replace or delete:

| Preset | What it writes |
|---|---|
| **Logo Package** | SVG, PNG at 1x, PNG at 2x with the `@2x` suffix, PDF, and a PDF with printer's marks and the `-print` suffix, in one sub-folder per format |
| **Print-Ready PDF** | One PDF with printer's marks, the document's bleed and the `-print` suffix |

To share presets with another computer, use **Export Preset…** and **Import Preset…** in the Asset Export panel menu (see the next section). Preset files have the `.vcexportpresets` extension.

## Collect and export assets

An asset is a piece of art that Export for Screens exports on its own, cropped to its bounds and named after the asset.

1. Select the art you want to export.
2. Choose **Object → Collect for Export → As Single Asset** to make one asset of the whole selection, or **As Multiple Assets** to make one asset per object. Each asset is named after its object, or Asset 1, Asset 2 and so on.
3. Choose **Window → Asset Export** to see the document's assets as thumbnails with their names.
4. In the panel, double-click an asset to rename it. Click to select assets, and hold **Shift** or **Ctrl** (**Cmd** on macOS) to add to the selection. The trash icon removes the selected assets from the panel, and their art stays in the document.
5. Set the format rows under **Export Settings**. The panel shares its rows with Export for Screens.
6. Choose **Export** to write the selected assets (or all of them when none is selected) to a folder you pick. With assets selected, the button reads **Export N Selected**. The Export for Screens button in the panel opens the dialog on its **Assets** tab instead.

![A sunset city drawing with the Asset Export panel showing three collected assets, Sun, Crescent and Lantern, as thumbnails with their names. Lantern is selected and the button reads Export 1 Selected](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/asset-export.webp)

You can also drag art from the canvas into the Asset Export panel, or select it and click **+**. Each object becomes its own asset. Hold **Alt** (**Option** on macOS) to make one asset of all of them.

:::note
An asset stays linked to the objects it was collected from. Moving the art moves the area that is exported, and deleting the art removes it from the asset.
:::

**File → Export Selection…** collects the selected objects as one asset and opens Export for Screens on the Assets tab with that asset checked.

In the web version, **Export** in the panel downloads the files, and several files download as one `.zip` file.

### Use the Asset Export panel menu

The Asset Export panel menu has these commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Add Selected Artwork as One Asset** | Makes one asset of the selected objects. Available when art is selected. |
| **Add Selected Artwork as Multiple Assets** | Makes one asset of each selected object. Available when art is selected. |
| **Select All Assets** | Selects every asset in the panel |
| **Remove Selected Assets** | Removes the selected assets from the panel. Their art stays in the document. |
| **Export for Screens…** | Opens Export for Screens on the Assets tab, with the selected assets checked (or all of them when none is selected) |
| A preset name | Applies that format preset to the panel's export settings. The built-in presets come first, then the ones you saved. |
| **Save As Preset…** | Shows a **Name** field under Export Settings. Type a name and choose **Save** to save the panel's export settings as a preset. |
| **Save Changes** | Saves the panel's current export settings into the saved preset you applied last |
| **Delete Preset** | Deletes the saved preset you applied last |
| **Import Preset…** | Adds the presets of a `.vcexportpresets` file to your saved presets |
| **Export Preset…** | Writes the preset you applied last to a `.vcexportpresets` file named after it |

## Export one file with Export As

1. Choose **File → Export → Export As…**.
2. Pick a **Format**.
3. Turn on **Use Artboards** to write one file per artboard, named `<name>-<artboard>` with the format's extension, and choose **All** or a **Range**. For a PDF, each artboard becomes a page. With Use Artboards off, the export covers the bounds of the visible art.
4. Choose **Export…** and pick the file name. The options dialog for the format follows, for example PNG Options or SVG Options.

**Export As SVG…** goes straight to SVG Options, and **Export As PNG…** asks for the file and then opens PNG Options.

These formats are available from Export As:

| Kind | Formats |
|---|---|
| Vector | SVG, SVG Compressed (gzipped SVG), PDF, EPS, DXF, EMF, WMF |
| Raster | PNG, PNG-8, JPEG, WebP, GIF, TIFF, BMP, Targa, PSD |
| Text | Text: the document's text, in stacking order from back to front |
| Document | VectorCraft Template |

The **Format** list ends with **DWG (use DXF)**, which is unavailable: VectorCraft does not write DWG files, so export DXF instead. Formats added by installed exporter plug-ins come after the built-in formats. A plug-in writes the whole document, so **Use Artboards** is unavailable for its format.

After you pick the file, this is what follows:

| Format | What opens next |
|---|---|
| SVG, SVG Compressed | SVG Options |
| PDF with Use Artboards on | The Save PDF dialog, with one page per artboard |
| PNG, PNG-8, JPEG, WebP, GIF, TIFF, BMP, Targa, PSD | The format's options dialog, for example PNG Options |
| EPS | EPS Options |
| DXF | DXF Options |
| Text | Text Export Options |
| PDF with Use Artboards off, EMF, WMF, VectorCraft Template | No dialog: VectorCraft writes the file |

## Set the options for each format

Each options dialog has **Cancel** and **Export**. Export writes the file you picked in Export As.

![The PNG Options dialog over the App Icon Set artboards, with Resolution set to High (300 ppi), Background Color set to Transparent, Anti-aliasing set to Art Optimized, Interlaced turned off and a size of 4267 × 4267 px](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/export-png-options.webp)

### Options shared by the raster formats

PNG, PNG-8, JPEG, WebP, GIF, TIFF, BMP, Targa and PSD start with these rows:

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|

| **Scale** | Sets how many DXF units 1 unit of the art becomes. Pick the unit (Millimeters by default) and type the number of DXF units (1 by default, from 0.000001 to 1000000). |
| **Scale Lineweights** | Scales lineweights by the Scale value. When it is off, lineweights keep their printed width. Off by default. |
| **Number of Colors** | 8 Colors, 16 Colors, 256 Colors or True Colors (the default). True Colors needs version 2004 or later; earlier versions get the nearest of 256 colors. |
| **Raster File Format** | PNG (the default) or JPEG, for placed images |
| **Export Option** | **Preserve Appearance** (the default) turns type into outlines, and strokes that a CAD line cannot draw into filled shapes. **Maximize Editability** keeps type as text, and writes every stroke as a line with its lineweight and dashes. |
| **Export Selected Art Only** | Exports only the selection. Available when art is selected. |
| **Alter Paths for Appearance** | Writes a stroke that a CAD line cannot draw as the filled area it paints, for example a stroke wider than the widest lineweight. Off by default. |

### Text Export Options

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| **Encoding** | UTF-8 (the default) or UTF-16 (Unicode) |
| **Line Endings** | LF (macOS, Linux) or CRLF (Windows). The default matches your operating system. |
| **Selection Only** | Writes only the text of the selected objects. Available when objects are selected. |

## Set SVG options

The SVG Options dialog opens from **Export As SVG…**, from Export As when the format is SVG, and when you save a document as SVG. VectorCraft keeps your choices for the next export.

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| **SVG Profile** | SVG 1.1 or SVG Tiny 1.2 |
| **Styling** | Internal CSS (the default), Presentation Attributes, Style Attributes, or Style Attributes (Entity References) |
| **Font** | SVG keeps text as text; Convert To Outlines writes it as shapes |
| **Images** | Embed puts images inside the SVG; Link writes them as separate files |
| **Object IDs** | Layer Names, Minimal or Unique |
| **Decimal** | Digits after the decimal point, from 1 to 7 (default 3) |
| **Encoding** | Unicode (UTF-8), Unicode (UTF-16) or ISO 8859-1 |
| **Minify** | Writes the file without extra spaces and line breaks |
| **Responsive** | On by default; leaves out the width and height so the SVG scales to its container |
| **Embed Fonts (Glyphs Used)** | Puts the glyphs the text uses into the file |
| **Fewer \<tspan\> Elements** | Writes text with fewer `<tspan>` elements |
| **Include Metadata** | Adds the document's metadata |
| **Use Artboards** | On by default; exports all artboards or a range, one file each |

Embed Fonts and Fewer \<tspan\> Elements are unavailable when Font is set to Convert To Outlines. SVG Tiny 1.2 uses presentation attributes and does not embed fonts. When you save a document as SVG, the dialog shows **Preserve Editing Capabilities** in place of Use Artboards.

Choose **Show Code** to see the SVG markup the current settings write, and **Hide Code** to close it.

![The SVG Options dialog over the badge, with styling, font, image, object ID and decimal settings, Minimal object IDs, 2 decimals and Minify turned on, and the code preview showing the SVG markup](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/svg-options.webp)

:::tip
To write a smaller SVG, choose Minimal object IDs and a low Decimal value, and turn on Minify. Check the result with Show Code before you export.
:::

## Keep small art sharp on screen

1. Choose **View → Pixel Preview** (**Ctrl+Alt+Y**, or **Cmd+Option+Y** on macOS) to see the art as it will look when written to pixels.
2. Turn on **View → Snap to Pixel** so that the objects you draw or move snap to whole pixels.
3. To fix art you have already drawn, select it and choose **Object → Make Pixel Perfect**. It snaps each object's edges to the pixel grid, places odd stroke weights on half pixels, and rounds stroke weights.

## Compare web image settings

**File → Export → Save for Web (Legacy)…** (**Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S**, or **Cmd+Option+Shift+S** on macOS) previews the art as an optimized GIF, JPEG, PNG-8 or PNG-24 image. The **Original**, **Optimized**, **2-Up** and **4-Up** views show the original beside one or more optimized versions, each with its file size and download time. The dialog also sets colors, dither, transparency and matte, JPEG quality, the color table and the image size.

- **Save…** keeps the settings and writes the files.
- **Done** keeps the settings and does not write any files.

![The Save for Web dialog on its 2-Up view, with the 512 by 512 px badge artboard shown as the original and as a PNG-8 image of 26.0K with 32 colors that downloads in 4 seconds at 56.6 Kbps. The settings column shows the PNG-8 format, Selective reduction, 32 colors, Diffusion dither at 100% and the top of the color table](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/save-for-web.webp)

1. Make the artboard you want to export the active artboard.
2. Choose **File → Export → Save for Web (Legacy)…**. The dialog opens on the 2-Up view at 100%, with the active artboard and the settings you used last. With more than one artboard, the **Artboard** list under **Clip to Artboard** picks another one.
3. Pick a **Preset**, or choose a **Format** and set its options. The settings column scrolls when it is taller than the dialog.
4. Compare the file size and download time under each preview. On the 4-Up view, the two extra panes show lighter versions of your settings, such as a lower JPEG quality or fewer colors. Click one to take its settings.
5. Choose **Save…** and pick the file name. In the web version the button reads **Download**.

These controls sit under the preview:

| Control | Choices |
|---|---|
| Zoom | Fit in View, 50%, 100% (the default), 200% or 400%. Drag a preview to move it. |
| **Download** | The connection speed that the download times assume, from 28.8 Kbps to 8 Mbps. The default is 56.6 Kbps. |
| **Preview in Browser** | Writes an HTML page with the image to a temporary folder and opens it in your browser. Available in the desktop app only. |

The settings column has these options. The rows change with the format.

| Option | Formats | Choices |
|---|---|---|
| **Preset:** | All | The built-in presets for GIF, JPEG, PNG-8 and PNG-24, then the presets you saved. It reads [Unnamed] when the settings match no preset. The disk button shows a **Name:** field with **Save**, and the trash icon deletes the saved preset that is shown. |
| **Format:** | All | GIF (the default), JPEG, PNG-8 or PNG-24 |
| **Reduction:** | GIF, PNG-8 | Perceptual, Selective (the default), Adaptive, Web, Black & White or Grayscale |
| **Colors:** | GIF, PNG-8 | 2 to 256 (default 128), from the list or typed |
| **Dither:**, **Amount:** | GIF, PNG-8 | No Dither, Diffusion (the default), Pattern or Noise, with an amount from 0% to 100% (default 100%) |
| **Transparency** | GIF, PNG-8, PNG-24 | Keeps transparent areas transparent. On by default. |
| **Interlaced** | GIF, PNG-8, PNG-24 | Writes an interlaced image. Off by default. |
| **Matte** | All | None, White (the default), Black, or Other, which shows a color button |
| **Web Snap** | GIF, PNG-8 | 0% to 100% (default 0%) |
| **Lossy** | GIF | 0% to 100% (default 0%) |
| **Quality** | JPEG | Low (10), Medium (30), High (60, the default), Very High (80) or Maximum (100), with a slider for any value from 0 to 100 |
| **Progressive** | JPEG | Off by default |
| **Optimized** | JPEG | On by default |
| **ICC Profile** | JPEG | Embeds the color profile. Off by default. |
| **Convert to sRGB** | All | On by default |
| **Metadata** | All | None, Copyright (the default), Copyright and Contact Info, or All |
| **Color Table** | GIF, PNG-8 | The image's colors as swatches. Select a swatch, then choose **Transparent** (or **Restore**), **Web Shift** (or **Unshift**) or **Lock** (or **Unlock**). **Order** sorts the table: Unsorted, Sort by Hue, Sort by Luminance or Sort by Popularity. |
| **Image Size** → **W**, **H** | All | The width and height in pixels. Changing one changes the other in proportion. |
| **Percent** | All | The size as a percentage of the art's size |
| **Anti-aliasing** | All | None, Art Optimized (the default) or Type Optimized |
| **Clip to Artboard** | All | Exports the artboard's area. On by default. With more than one artboard, an **Artboard** list picks which one. |
| **Slices** | All | All Slices, Selected Slices or No Slices. Shown when the document has slices. |
| **Output** | All | Images Only (the default) or HTML and Images |

For slices and their HTML output, see [Slice artwork for the web](/apps/vectorcraft/slice-artwork-for-the-web/).

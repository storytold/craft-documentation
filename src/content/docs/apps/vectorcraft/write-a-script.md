summary: Write JavaScript files that run VectorCraft's commands.
parent: workflows
---

This guide shows you how to write a JavaScript file (`.js` or `.jsx`) that runs VectorCraft's commands on the open documents, and how to run it from the app, from `vectorcraft-cli` or from a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client. To add scripts to the **File → Scripts** menu, answer their questions and read the Script Console, see [Run scripts](/apps/vectorcraft/run-scripts/).

## Write your first script

1. Create a text file named `lantern.jsx` in any folder, and save it as UTF-8.
2. Add these lines:

   ```js
   #target vectorcraft

   var lantern = vc.run("shape.ellipse", { x: 100, y: 100, width: 28, height: 36 });
   vc.run("paint.setFill", { ids: [lantern.id], color: "#F59E0B" });
   $.writeln("Drew lantern " + lantern.id);
   ```

3. Open a document in VectorCraft.
4. Choose **File → Scripts → Other Script…**, or press **Ctrl+F12** (**Cmd+F12** on macOS). Choose `lantern.jsx`, and click **Run** in the **Run Script** warning. The warning does not appear when **Show External Script Warning** is off in **Edit → Preferences… → General** (on macOS, **VectorCraft → Settings → General…**).
5. Choose **Window → Script Console** to read the line the script wrote.

The script draws an amber ellipse. A run that finishes adds one undo step, **Run Script**, to each document it changed, so **Ctrl+Z** (**Cmd+Z** on macOS) undoes the whole run.

In the following image, the script `lantern-row.jsx` copied a selected amber lantern and coral lantern along a string until eight lanterns hang across the document. It then selected the lanterns and wrote three lines to the Script Console.

![The lantern-row.vectorcraft document at 125% zoom: a violet dusk sky with a pale moon over teal rooftops with lit windows, and eight amber and coral lanterns hanging from a lavender string, selected inside one bounding box. The Script Console is docked under the Properties panel in a wide right-hand column and shows run 3 of Lantern Row: the start line, "Drawing 8 lanterns", "Lantern 1 at x = 100", "Lantern 8 at x = 520", the Finished line, and the report line "0 ms, 19 host calls; slowest: edit.duplicate ×6 0 ms, select.set ×1 0 ms", above the Clear, Copy Selected and Copy All buttons.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/write-a-script-console.webp)

## Run commands with vc.run

`vc.run(id, params)` runs one VectorCraft command and returns its result. `id` is the command's id as a string. `params` is an object of the command's parameters, and you can leave it out when the command needs none.

```js
var rect = vc.run("shape.rectangle", { x: 10, y: 10, width: 20, height: 20 });
// rect is { id: 2 }: the id of the new rectangle
vc.run("select.set", { ids: [rect.id] });
vc.run("select.all");
```

- The result is the same value the command returns anywhere else, such as `{ id }` for a new shape. Pass the ids it gives to later commands.
- Each command checks its own parameters and is enabled or disabled as it is in the menus. Most commands act on the selection when you do not give `ids`.
- To find a command's id and parameters, read `vc.commands` in the script, run `vectorcraft-cli commands`, or choose **Help → Search Commands…**. See [Automate VectorCraft](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/).
- `vc.run` throws a `TypeError` when the id is not a string ("vc.run: give a command id, as a string"), when the parameters are not an object ("vc.run: the parameters must be an object"), or when you give more than two arguments.
- A result larger than 64 levels, 16 MiB or 1,048,576 entries throws a `RangeError`, and VectorCraft puts that command's changes back.

## Handle a command that fails

A command that fails throws an `Error` whose message says what went wrong. VectorCraft puts back the documents and the session state that the command changed, so the script can catch the error and go on:

```js
try {
    vc.run("object.move", { ids: [99999], dx: 10, dy: 0 });
} catch (e) {
    $.writeln("Skipped: " + e.message);
    // Skipped: invalid parameters for `object.move`: no such object id 99999
}
```

When the script does not catch an error, the run ends with **Ended with an error**, and every open document goes back to how it was before the run. In both cases, files that a command saved or exported stay on disk. The failed command's error message names the files it wrote, and for an error the script does not catch, the message that ends the run names them.

A script cannot catch these, and each one ends the run and puts the documents back:

- A click on **Stop** in the status bar or in a dialog.
- An internal fault in VectorCraft.
- A limit on the run, such as its 2,000,000 calls to VectorCraft. [Run scripts](/apps/vectorcraft/run-scripts/#read-a-scripts-output-in-the-script-console) lists the limits.

## Read the document

`vc.document` is a snapshot of the active document, taken each time the script reads it. It is `null` when no document is open.

| Property | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `name` | The document's name, as its tab shows it |
| `path` | The file the document was opened from or saved to, or `null` for a document that has not been saved |
| `modified` | `true` when the document has unsaved changes |
| `artboards` | The number of artboards |
| `layers` | The number of top-level layers |
| `selection` | The ids of the selected objects, up to the first 1,000 |
| `selectionCount` | The number of selected objects |

```js
var doc = vc.document;
if (doc === null) {
    alert("Open a document first.", "Lantern Row", true);
} else if (doc.selectionCount === 0) {
    alert("Select the lanterns to recolor.", "Lantern Row");
}
```

`vc.commands` lists every command a script can run. Each entry has the command's `id`, its `label` as the menus show it, and `params`, a text description of its parameters.

## Write to the Script Console

| Function | What it writes |
|---|---|
| `$.write(value, ...)` | Each value as text, one after another, without ending the line |
| `$.writeln(value, ...)` | The same as `$.write`, then ends the line |
| `vc.log(value)` | One line in the Script Console. A value that is not a string is written as JSON, for example `{"done":true}`. The value also goes in the run's report, in its `log` list. |

A run can add up to 10,000 `vc.log` entries and 4 MiB of them. Past either limit, `vc.log` throws a `RangeError`. Each line in the Script Console starts with the run's number and the script's name. See [Read a script's output in the Script Console](/apps/vectorcraft/run-scripts/#read-a-scripts-output-in-the-script-console).

## Ask the person running the script

| Call | Buttons | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `alert(message, title, errorIcon)` | **OK**, **Stop** | `undefined` |
| `confirm(message, noAsDflt, title)` | **Yes**, **No**, **Stop** | `true` for **Yes**, `false` for **No** |
| `prompt(message, preset, title)` | **OK**, **Cancel**, **Stop** | The text in the field for **OK**, `null` for **Cancel** |

- Only `message` is required, except that `prompt` also requires `preset`, the text its field starts with.
- `title` is the dialog's title. Without one, the title is **Script Alert**.
- `errorIcon` set to `true` shows a red **!** beside the alert's message.
- `noAsDflt` set to `true` makes **No** the highlighted button, which Enter clicks.
- The script waits at the call until the person answers. **Stop** ends the script and undoes everything it did.
- A message can be up to 16 KiB, a title 256 bytes and a preset 16 KiB. Longer text throws a `RangeError`.
- A dialog cannot open inside a function that a built-in calls back, such as an `Array.prototype.sort` comparison, inside a getter or a conversion, or inside a file that `$.evalFile` runs. A call there throws an error.

```js
if (!confirm("Replace the 8 lanterns on this layer?", true, "Lantern Row")) {
    // The person clicked No, or pressed Esc
}
```

![The VectorCraft window with a confirm dialog titled Lantern Row over the lantern row, asking "Replace the 8 lanterns on this layer?" with Stop on the left and No, highlighted in coral, and Yes on the right. The eight selected lanterns and the teal rooftops show around it, the Script Console shows the start line of run 4, and the status bar shows "Running a script..." with a Stop button.](/assets/uploads/vectorcraft/write-a-script-confirm.webp)

## Pass values to a script

`vc.args` holds the `args` object that the run was started with. A script run from the **File → Scripts** menu gets an empty object, so give each value a default:

```js
var count = vc.args.count || 8;
```

To pass values, run the script with the `script.run` command and an `args` object of up to 1 MiB as JSON. See [Run a script without a window](#run-a-script-without-a-window).

To check what the running version of VectorCraft offers, read `vc.api.version`, which is `"1.0"` in VectorCraft 0.24.1, or call `vc.api.has(name)`. `vc.api.has` returns `true` for `run`, `document`, `commands`, `log`, `args`, `console`, `dialogs` and `dollar`, and `false` for any other name.

## Read files next to the script

A script can read files with `File` and `Folder` inside its own folder and the folders below it. When VectorCraft or `vectorcraft-cli mcp` was started with `--automation-read-root` folders, a script reads only where its own folder and those folders overlap. A relative path starts at the script's folder. In the web version of VectorCraft, every file lookup fails.

```js
var notes = new File("notes.txt");
if (notes.exists && notes.open("r")) {
    var title = notes.readln();   // the first line
    var rest = notes.read();      // everything after it
    notes.close();
}
var texts = Folder($.fileName.replace(/[\\/][^\\/]*$/, "")).getFiles("*.txt");
```

| Member | What it does |
|---|---|
| `exists`, `length`, `created`, `modified` | The file's state, size in bytes and dates |
| `getFiles(mask)` | On a `Folder`, lists up to 2,048 entries sorted by name. A mask uses `*` and `?` and ignores case. A function that takes each entry and returns `true` or `false` also works as a mask. |
| `resolve()` | The path with links and `..` resolved |
| `open("r")` | Opens the file for reading and returns `true` |
| `read()`, `readln()`, `readch()` | Reads the rest of the file, the next line, or the next character |
| `seek(pos)`, `tell()` | Sets and returns the position in bytes |
| `close()` | Closes the file |

- A path outside the script's folder, a network or device path, and a link that leads outside give `false` or `null`, and the object's `error` is "Script file access denied".
- A file can be up to 8 MiB, and a run can read up to 32 MiB of files in all.
- Writing, copying, renaming and deleting files through `File` and `Folder` is not available. These calls return `false` or `null` and set `error`, for example to "Script file writing is not available". To write a file, run a command that saves or exports, such as `file.export`.
- A script given as text, with `source` instead of `path`, cannot read any file.
- VectorCraft reads a file in the encoding its byte order mark names (UTF-8, UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE), otherwise in the encoding the script set, otherwise as UTF-8 when the bytes are valid UTF-8, and otherwise as Windows-1252.

The `$` object describes the run:

| Member | What it gives |
|---|---|
| `$.fileName` | The path of the script file, or an empty string for a script given as text |
| `$.evalFile(path)` | Runs another file in the same global variables and returns its last value. The path is relative to the file being run, and the file must be inside the script's folder. |
| `$.includePath` | The folders that the last `#includepath` line set |
| `$.engineName` | The name that `#targetengine` gave, or `VectorCraft` without one |

## Directives

A directive is a line that begins with `#` or `//@`, outside strings and comments. VectorCraft reads the directives before the script runs.

| Directive | What it does |
|---|---|
| `#include "file.jsx"` or `//@include "file.jsx"` | Inserts another file in place of the line. See [What a script can change](/apps/vectorcraft/run-scripts/#what-a-script-can-change). |
| `#includepath "folder"` | Sets the folders that `#include` searches after the folder of the including file. A later `#includepath` line replaces the list. |
| `#script "Name"` | Names the run. The Script Console, error messages and the run's report use this name instead of the file name. |
| `#target name` | VectorCraft accepts the line with any value and ignores it. |
| `#strict on` | Makes the script throw a `TypeError` when it assigns to a read-only property or a property that has only a getter, or adds a property to an object that is not extensible (after `Object.preventExtensions`, `Object.seal` or `Object.freeze`), or to `vc` or `$`. It does not turn on the rest of strict mode; use `'use strict'` for that. |
| `#strict off` | Turns those checks off. The last `#strict` line of the script and its included files sets the whole run. Without one, the checks are off. |
| `#targetengine name` | Runs the script in a named engine. See [Keep values between runs](#keep-values-between-runs). |

VectorCraft stops a script that has an `#engine` line ("unsupported script directive") or a `#` line with any other name ("unknown script directive"). A `//@` line with any other name is a comment.

## Commands a script cannot run

A script cannot run commands that change something outside the documents. `vc.run` throws an `Error` such as "a script cannot run `prefs.set`" for these commands, and the script can catch it. `vc.commands` leaves them out.

| Kind | Commands |
|---|---|
| Whole groups | Every command whose id starts with `script.` (except `script.check`), `plugin.`, `prefs.`, `actionSet.`, `shortcutSet.`, `help.`, `print.`, `library.`, `importMatches.`, `edit.undoGroup.`, `file.recovery.` or `stroke.widthProfile.` |
| Presets | Commands that save, import or delete a preset |
| Fonts and links | `text.addFontFiles`, `text.findFontFiles`, `text.rescanFonts`, `links.findFiles`, `file.place.queue` |
| Color and proofing | `color.loadProfile`, `color.removeProfile`, `view.proofSetup`, `view.proofColors`, `view.overprintPreview`, `view.separationsPreview` |
| Other | `file.print`, `edit.clearHistory` |

While a script runs, you cannot edit, select or save the documents, and other programs' commands that change anything end with a busy error.

## Keep values between runs

A script that starts with `#targetengine name` runs in an engine of that name. The engine keeps the script's global variables and functions, and the next run that names the same engine finds them:

```js
#targetengine "lanterns"

if (typeof runs === "undefined") runs = 0;
runs++;
$.writeln("Run " + runs + " in " + $.engineName);
```

- The name is letters, digits and `_`, not starting with a digit, or a quoted name of 1 to 64 bytes. Names are compared as written.
- The line must be in the script itself, only once, before the first line of code and before any `#include` line. Comments, blank lines and other directives can come before it.
- A script without the line, or with `#targetengine main`, starts with new global variables each time.
- A session keeps up to eight named engines, each with up to 64 MiB of memory. A script that names a ninth engine stops with an error that tells you to drop one with `script.engine.drop`.
- When a run ends with an error, a limit or **Stop**, the documents go back, but the engine keeps the global variables that the run set.
- Named engines are not available in the web version of VectorCraft.
- An engine lasts until VectorCraft quits, or until you drop it.

The `script.engines` command lists the named engines, with each one's name, its memory in `heapBytes` and whether a run is using it. `script.engine.drop` with `{"name": "lanterns"}` drops an engine and its global variables, and the next run that names it starts fresh. You cannot drop `main` or the engine of the running script. Run these two commands from an MCP client connected to the app, or as steps of the same `vectorcraft-cli run` that runs the scripts.

## Run a script without a window

The `script.run` command runs a script in the session that receives it. `vectorcraft-cli run` runs it without a window:

```sh
cd ~/Art/lanterns
vectorcraft-cli run --in lantern-row.vectorcraft --cmd script.run --params '{"path":"lantern-row.jsx","args":{"count":6}}' --export lantern-row.png
```

In Windows PowerShell 5.1, put the parameters in a variable and escape each inner double quote with a backslash:

```powershell
cd ~\Art\lanterns
$params = '{\"path\":\"lantern-row.jsx\",\"args\":{\"count\":6}}'
vectorcraft-cli run --in lantern-row.vectorcraft --cmd script.run --params $params --export lantern-row.png
```

`script.run` takes these parameters:

| Parameter | What it does |
|---|---|
| `path` | The `.js` or `.jsx` file to run. A relative path starts at the current folder. |
| `source` | The script's text, instead of `path`. Give one of the two. |
| `name` | The name for errors and the report. The default is the script's `#script` line, else the file name, else `script`. |
| `args` | An object the script reads as `vc.args`, up to 1 MiB as JSON |
| `answers` | The answers to the script's dialogs, in order, for a run with nobody to answer them: `{"kind": "alert", "value": "ok"}`, `{"kind": "confirm", "value": true}` or `false`, and `{"kind": "prompt", "value": "text"}` or `null`. Up to 10,000 answers and 1 MiB as JSON. |
| `maxFuel` | The number of instructions the script may run, from 1 to 100,000,000,000. The default is 1,000,000,000. |

```json
{"path": "lantern-row.jsx", "answers": [{"kind": "confirm", "value": true}], "maxFuel": 5000000000}
```

A run with nobody to answer its dialogs takes the next answer from `answers` for each dialog. The run ends with an error when no answer is left ("confirm: `answers` has no answer left for this dialog"), when the next answer is for another kind of dialog, or when the script finishes with answers left over. In the app, `answers` is refused, because the person answers the dialogs.

`vectorcraft-cli` prints the run's report as JSON. The report lists the documents the script changed (`changed`), the files its commands wrote (`written`), its `log` values, its Script Console lines (`console`), each dialog and its answer (`dialogs`), the instructions it used (`fuelUsed`), its calls to VectorCraft (`hostCalls`), how long it took (`runTimeMs`) and its slowest commands. A run that fails stops `vectorcraft-cli` with the error, its line and its column.

From an MCP client, call the `run_command` tool with `command` set to `script.run` and the same parameters in `params`. A headless server returns the report at once. In a server connected to the app, `script.run` returns `{"running": true, "name": "..."}`, the person answers the dialogs in the window, and when the run ends, the client reads the report in the `scriptReport` field of the `ui_inspect` tool's result (the app's `ui.inspect` method). See [AI agents](/apps/vectorcraft/ai-agents/) and [Drive VectorCraft from an MCP client](/apps/vectorcraft/automate-vectorcraft/#drive-vectorcraft-from-an-mcp-client).

For a series of commands that needs no loops or conditions, a steps file is simpler than a script. See [Write command steps for vectorcraft-cli](/apps/vectorcraft/write-command-steps/).
